CrashCourse Computer Science! Over the past two episodes, we\\u2019ve talked a lot about computer security. But the fact is, there\\u2019s no such thing as a perfectly, 100% secure, computer system. There will always be bugs and security experts know that. So system architects employ a strategy called defence in depth, which uses many layers of varying security mechanisms to frustrate attackers. It\\u2019s a bit like how castles are designed \\u2013 first you\\u2019ve got to dodge the archers, then cross the moat, scale the walls, avoid the hot oil, get over the ramparts, and defeat the guards before you get to the throne room, but in this case we\\u2019re talking about one of the most common forms of computer security - Cryptography. INTRO The word cryptography comes from the roots \\u2018crypto\\u2019 and \\u2018graphy\\u2019, roughly translating to \\u201csecret writing\\u201d. In order to make information secret, you use a cipher \\u2013 an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext, which is gibberish unless you have a key that lets you undo the cipher. The process of making text secret is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption. Ciphers have been used long before computers showed up. Julius Caesar used what\\u2019s now called a Caesar cipher, to encrypt private correspondence. He would shift the letters in a message forward by three places. So, A became D, and the word \\\"brutus\\\" became this: \\\"euxwxv\\\". To decipher the message, recipients had to know both the algorithm and the number to shift by, which acted as the key. The Caesar cipher is one example of a larger class of techniques called substitution ciphers. These replace every letter in a message with something else according to a translation. A big drawback of basic substitution ciphers is that letter frequencies are preserved. For example, E is the most common letter in English, so if your cipher translates E to an X, then X will show up the most frequently in the ciphertext. A skilled cryptanalyst can work backwards from these kinds of statistics to figure out the message. Indeed, it was the breaking of a substitution cipher that led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 for plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth. Another fundamental class of techniques are permutation ciphers. Let\\u2019s look at a simple example, called a columnar transposition cipher. Here, we take a message, and fill the letters into a grid. In this case, we\\u2019ve chosen 5 by 5. To encrypt our message, we read out the characters in a different order, let\\u2019s say from the bottom left, working upwards, one column at a time. The new letter ordering, what\\u2019s called a permutation, is the encrypted message. The ordering direction, as well as the 5 by 5 grid size, serves as the key. Like before, if the cipher and key are known, a recipient can reverse the process to reveal the original message. By the 1900s, cryptography was mechanized in the form of encryption machines. The most famous was the German Enigma, used by the Nazis to encrypt their wartime communications. As we discussed back in Episode 15, the Enigma was a typewriter-like machine, with a keyboard and lampboard, both showing the full alphabet. Above that, there was a series of configurable rotors that were the key to the Enigma\\u2019s encryption capability. First, let\\u2019s look at just one rotor. One side had electrical contacts for all 26 letters. These connected to the other side of the rotor using cross-crossing wires that swapped one letter for another. If \\u2018H\\u2019 went in, \\u2018K\\u2019 might come out the other side. If \\u201cK\\u2019 went in, \\u2018F\\u2019 might come out, and so on. This letter swapping behavior should sound familiar: it\\u2019s a substitution cipher! But, the Enigma was more sophisticated because it used three or more rotors in a row, each feeding into the next. Rotors could also be rotated to one of 26 possible starting positions, and they could be inserted in different orders, providing a lot of different substitution mappings. Following the rotors was a special circuit called a reflector. Instead of passing the signal on to another rotor, it connected every pin to another, and sent the electrical signal back through the rotors. Finally, there was a plugboard at the front of the machine that allowed letters coming from the keyboard to be optionally swapped, adding another level of complexity. With our simplified circuit, let\\u2019s encrypt a letter on this example enigma configuration. If we press the \\u2018H\\u2019 key, electricity flows through the plugboard, then the rotors, hits the reflector, comes back through the rotors and plugboard, and illuminates the letter \\u2018L\\u2019 on the lampboard. So H is encrypted to L. Note that the circuit can flow both ways \\u2013 so if we typed the letter \\u2018L\\u2019, \\u2018H\\u2019 would light up. In other words, it\\u2019s the same process for encrypting and decrypting; you just have to make sure the sending and receiving machines have the same initial configuration. If you look carefully at this circuit, you\\u2019ll notice it\\u2019s impossible for a letter to be encrypted as itself, which turned out to be a fatal cryptographic weakness. Finally, to prevent the Enigma from being a simple substitution cipher, every single time a letter was entered, the rotors advanced by one spot, sort of like an odometer in a car. So if you entered the text A-A-A, it might come out as B-D-K, where the substitution mapping changed with every key press. The Enigma was a tough cookie to crack, for sure. But as we discussed in Episode 15, Alan Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park were able to break Enigma codes and largely automate the process. But with the advent of computers, cryptography moved from hardware into software. One of the earliest software ciphers to become widespread was the Data Encryption Standard developed by IBM and the NSA in 1977. DES, as it was known, originally used binary keys that were 56 bits long, which means that there are 2 to the 56, or about 72 quadrillion different keys. Back in 1977, that meant that nobody \\u2013 except perhaps the NSA \\u2013 had enough computing power to brute-force all possible keys. But, by 1999, a quarter-million dollar computer could try every possible DES key in just two days, rendering the cipher insecure. So, in 2001, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was finalized and published. AES is designed to use much bigger keys \\u2013 128, 192 or 256 bits in size \\u2013 making brute force attacks much, much harder. For a 128-bit keys, you'd need trillions of years to try every combination, even if you used every single computer on the planet today. So you better get started! AES chops data up into 16-byte blocks, and then applies a series of substitutions and permutations, based on the key value, plus some other operations to obscure the message, and this process is repeated ten or more times for each block. You might be wondering: why only ten rounds? Or why only 128 bit keys, and not ten thousand bit keys? Well, it\\u2019s a performance tradeoff. If it took hours to encrypt and send an email, or minutes to connect to a secure website, people wouldn't use it. AES balances performance and security to provide practical cryptography. Today, AES is used everywhere, from encrypting files on iPhones and transmitting data over WiFi with WPA2, to accessing websites using HTTPS. So far, the cryptographic techniques we\\u2019ve discussed rely on keys that are known by both sender and recipient. The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key. In the old days, keys would be shared by voice, or physically; for example, the Germans distributed codebooks with daily settings for their Enigma machines. But this strategy could never work in the internet era. Imagine having to crack open a codebook to connect to youtube! What\\u2019s needed is a way for a server to send a secret key over the public internet to a user wishing to connect securely. It seems like that wouldn\\u2019t be secure, because if the key is sent in the open and intercepted by a hacker, couldn\\u2019t they use that to decrypt all communication between the two? The solution is key exchange! \\u2013 An algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one. We can do this with one-way functions \\u2013 mathematical operations that are very easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse. To show you how one-way functions work, let\\u2019s use paint colors as an analogy. It\\u2019s easy to mix paint colors together, but it\\u2019s not so easy to figure out the constituent colors that were used to make a mixed paint color. You\\u2019d have to test a lot of possibilities to figure it out. In this metaphor, our secret key is a unique shade of paint. First, there\\u2019s a public paint color that everyone can see. Then, John and I each pick a secret paint color. To exchange keys, I mix my secret paint color with the public paint color. Then, I send that mixed color to John by any means \\u2013 mail, carrier pigeon, whatever. John does the same \\u2013 mixing his secret paint color with the public color, then sending that to me. When I receive John\\u2019s color, I simply add my private color to create a blend of all three paints. John does the same with my mixed color. And Voila! We both end up with the same paint color! We can use this as a shared secret, even though we never sent each other our individual secret colors. A snooping outside observer would know partial information, but they\\u2019d find it very difficult to figure out our shared secret color. Of course, sending and mixing paint colors isn\\u2019t going to work well for transmitting computer data. But luckily, mathematical one-way functions are perfect, and this is what Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange uses. In Diffie-Hellman, the one-way function is modular exponentiation. This means taking one number, the base, to the power of another number, the exponent, and taking the remainder when dividing by a third number, the modulus. So, for example, if we wanted to calculate 3 to the 5th power, modulo 31, we would calculate 3 to the 5th, which is 243, then take the remainder when divided by 31, which is 26. The hard part is figuring out the exponent given only the result and the base. If I tell you I raised 3 to some secret number, modulo 31, and got 7 as the remainder, you'd have to test a lot of exponents to know which one I picked. If we make these numbers big, say hundreds of digits long, then finding the secret exponent is nearly impossible. Now let\\u2019s talk about how Diffie-Hellman uses modular exponentiation to calculate a shared key. First, there's a set of public values \\u2013 the base and the modulus, that, like our public paint color, everyone gets to know... even the bad guys! To send a message securely to John, I would pick a secret exponent: X. Then, I\\u2019d calculate B to the power of X, modulo M. I send this big number over to John. John does the same, picking a secret exponent Y, and sending me B to the Y modulo M. To create a shared secret key, I take what John sent me, and take it to the power of X, my secret exponent. This is mathematically equivalent to B to the XY modulus M. John does the same, taking what I sent to him to the power of Y, and we both end up with the exact same number! It\\u2019s a secret shared key, even though we never sent each other our secret number. We can use this big number as a shared key for encrypted communication, using something like AES for encryption. Diffie-Hellman key exchange is one method for establishing a shared key. These keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides. The Caesar Cipher, Enigma and AES are all symmetric encryption. There\\u2019s also asymmetric encryption, where there are two different keys, most often one that\\u2019s public and another that\\u2019s private. So, people can encrypt a message using a public key that only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt. In other words, knowing the public key only lets you encrypt, but not decrypt \\u2013 it\\u2019s asymmetric! So, think about boxes with padlocks that you can open with a key. To receive a secure message, I can give a sender a box and padlock. They put their message in it and lock it shut. Now, they can send that box back to me and only I can open it, with my private key. After locking the box, neither the sender, nor anyone else who finds the box, can open it without brute force. In the same way, a digital public key can encrypt something that can only be decrypted with a private key. The reverse is possible too: encrypting something with a private key that can be decrypted with a public key. This is used for signing, where a server encrypts data using their private key. Anyone can decrypt it using the server's public key. This acts like an unforgeable signature, as only the owner, using their private key, can encrypt. It proves that you're getting data from the right server or person, and not an imposter. The most popular asymmetric encryption technique used today is RSA, named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. So, now you know all the \\u201ckey\\u201d parts of modern cryptography: symmetric encryption, key exchange and public-key cryptography. When you connect to a secure website, like your bank, that little padlock icon means that your computer has used public key cryptography to verify the server, key exchange to establish a secret temporary key, and symmetric encryption to protect all the back-and-forth communication from prying eyes. Whether you're buying something online, sending emails to BFFs, or just browsing cat videos, cryptography keeps all that safe, private and secure. Thanks cryptography!\",\n          \"Dictionaries are mappings from key objects to value objects. Dictionaries consists of Key:Value pairs, where the keys must be immutable and the values can be anything. Dictionaries themselves are mutable so this means once you create your dictionary, you can modify its contents on the fly. Dictionaries can be used for performing very fast look-ups on unordered data. A key aspect to be aware about regarding dictionaries is that they are not sequences, and therefore do not maintain any type of left-right order. This means that if you&#39;re looping over a dictionary, the Key:Value pairs will be iterated over in arbitrary order. Let&#39;s look at a diagram to clarify this idea. We&#39;re going to set up a simple dictionary where we have our first key that&#39;s associated with a value object. We have our second key that goes with another object. And let&#39;s say we have key number four here which goes with the corresponding value object. If this is a dictionary, this key object will always be associated with this value object. Similarly, this key will always go with this value object. When we say that dictionaries don&#39;t maintain any type of left or right order, what we&#39;re saying is that the ordering of these key-value pairs themselves is not defined. That means if I&#39;m looping over these pairs, I might first get the pair that corresponds to my second key here. Let&#39;s then look at some uses of dictionaries. I would like to set up a dictionary which is called age. And if I want this to be an empty dictionary, I have two ways to construct that. The first approach is just to use a pair of curly braces, and this would give me a dictionary age which would be empty at the time of construction. Another possibility is to type &quot;age = dict&quot;, which is a key word, open and close parentheses. And again I have created an empty dictionary. Let&#39;s then construct a dictionary that consists of names and ages. In this particular dictionary, the names are going to be the keys and the ages are going to be the value objects. Imagine the first task we&#39;d like to do is look up a person&#39;s age. We do this using the following syntax. We first type the name of the dictionary. We then follow with the square brackets. Inside the square brackets, we insert the key we&#39;re interested in looking up. Let&#39;s say, in this case, we&#39;d like to know, how old is Pam? So we&#39;d enter &quot;Pam&quot; inside the square brackets. And Python returns the result to us. Often, we&#39;d like to modify the value objects that are associated with specific keys. Let&#39;s say we would like to increase the age of Tim by one year. Here is how we could do this. We first take our age dictionary. We&#39;d like to modify Tim. And let&#39;s say we want to increase his age by one year. We could use the following kind of syntax. We could say age of Tim is equal to age of Tim plus 1. And this certainly works. However incrementing the value of an object by one, or by some other number, is a very common operation. And there&#39;s a very handy shorthand notation for doing that in Python. So let&#39;s take the age of Tim, and say we would like to increase that by one year, we can do the following: We can just type &quot;+= 1&quot;. And what happens if we check the age of Tim, we will have increased Tim age again by one year. Let&#39;s make sure we understand what happens when we say plus equals. When you&#39;re reading code from left to right, the plus operation happens first. Then we have the equal sign, which means assignment. So when we say something plus equals 1, for example, we first take the value of the object, we add one to that object, and then we reassign it back to the original object. A common mistake is sometimes to mix up the order of these two operations. Think about what happens if you say x equals plus 1. You&#39;re not incrementing the value of x by 1. Instead, you&#39;re saying that x should be assigned the value of plus 1, which is just the same thing as saying x is equal to 1. If you wish to increment the value of a variable by 1, you first do it the incrementation and then the assignment. That&#39;s why the order of these two operations is plus and then equals. You can use the dictionary method keys to find out what are all the keys in the dictionary. And similarly, you can use the values method to find out what are all of the values in the dictionary. When you call these methods, Python returns to you an object which has a very special type. The type of the returned object is what&#39;s called a &quot;view object&quot;. View objects do precisely what you might imagine that they do. They provide a dynamic view of the keys or values in the dictionary. A key point here is that as you update or modify your dictionary, the views will also change correspondingly. Let&#39;s now work with the dictionary that we just defined. We&#39;re going to first extract all of the names in the dictionary. So I&#39;ll do that by saying &quot;names = age.keys&quot;. Now let&#39;s just check the type of the object names. And Python confirms that this is a dictionary keys object. Let&#39;s say I would like to add a new key to my dictionary. Let&#39;s add a person called Tom who is 50 in our dictionary. So we say age[&quot;Tom&quot;] and we assign the value object 50 to that key. If we now ask, what are the names, you&#39;ll see that the view object also contains Tom. We didn&#39;t redefine the content of names, and this is the nature of view object. As we modify the dictionary, the content of the view object will change automatically. Let&#39;s look at the values method. So if we say age.values, Python returns to us all of the values in the dictionary. I&#39;m going to call this ages, and we can look at that object. So in this case, we have one, two, three, four, five different ages contained in the dictionary. I&#39;m going to add one more person to the dictionary. Let&#39;s call that person Nick, and let&#39;s say Nick is 31 years old. If I now ask Python, what are the names, you&#39;ll see that the name Nick is also contained in the names object. This is the nature of views objects-- their content is dynamically updated as you modify your dictionary. Finally, let&#39;s see how we&#39;ll test for membership in a dictionary. We know that we have a key Tom in our dictionary. If I want to ask if Tom is a member of our dictionary, if Tom is a key in our dictionary, I can ask, &quot;Tom&quot; in age? And the answer is going to be &quot;True&quot;. If I ask, is &quot;Zofia&quot; in our dictionary? Python is going to say &quot;False&quot;. This is how we test for object membership in a dictionary.\",\n          \"we previously defined the cost function J in this video I want to tell you about an algorithm called gradient descent for minimizing the cost function J it turns out gradient descent is a more general algorithm and is used not only in linear regression is actually used all over the place in machine learning and later in the class we'll use gradient descent to minimize other functions as well not just the cost function J for linear regression so in this video I'm going to talk about gradient descent for minimizing some arbitrary function J and then in later videos we'll take those algorithm and apply it specifically to the cost function J that we had defined for linear regression so here's the problem setup going to assume that we have some function J of theta 0 comma theta 1 maybe as a cost function from linear regression maybe it's some other function we want to minimize and we want to come over now algorithm for minimizing that as a function of j of theta0 theta1 just as an aside it turns out that gradient descent actually applies to more general functions so imagine if you have a function that's a function of j OS theta 0 theta 1 theta 2 up to say something that N and you want to minimize theta 0 you minimize over theta0 up to theta n of this J of theta 0 up to theta n it turns out gradient descent is an algorithm for solving of this more general problem but for the sake of brevity on for the sake of you know succinct ins of notation I'm just going to pretend I have only two parameters throughout the rest of this video here's the idea for gradients then what we're going to do is we're going to start off with some initial guesses for theta 0 and theta 1 doesn't really matter what they are but a common choice will be we set theta 0 to state 0 and set theta 1 to 0 just initialize them to 0 what we're going to do in gradient descent is we'll keep changing theta 0 and say the 1 a little bit they try to reduce J of theta 0 theta 1 until hopefully we wind up at a minimum or maybe a local so let's see what let's see in pictures what gradient descent does let's say you try to minimize this function so notice the axes this is a theta 0 theta 1 on the horizontal axis and J is the vertical axis and so the height of the surface shows J and we want to minimize this function so we're going to start off with theta 0 theta 1 at some point so imagine making some value for theta 0 theta 1 and that corresponds to starting at some points on the surface of this function okay so whatever value of theta 0 theta 1 gives you some point here I didn't initialize them to 0 0 but you know sometimes you neutralize it to other values as well now I want you to imagine that this figure shows a hole imagine this is like the landscape of some draw c-pop with you know two Hills like so and I want you to imagine that you are physically standing at that point on the hill right on this little red node on your Park in gradient descent what we're going to do is we're going to spin 360 degrees around just look all around us and also if I were to take a little baby step in some direction and I want to go downhill as quickly as possible what direction do I take that little baby step in if I want to go down if I sort of want to physically walk down this hill as rapidly as possible turns out that if you're standing at that point on the hill you look all around you find that the best direction to take a little little step downhill is roughly that direction okay and now you have this new point on your hill you're going to again look all around and then say what direction should I step in order to take a little baby step downhill and if you do that and take another step you take a step in that direction and then you keep going you know from this new point you look around taking decide what direction will take you down hill most quickly take another step another step and so on until you converge to this a local minimum down here here the dissenter is an interesting property this first time we ran gradient descent we were starting at this point over here right starts it at that point over here now imagine we have initialized gradient descent just a couple steps to the right imagine with a nationalized gradient descent with that points on the upper right if you were to repeat this process so stop at that point look all around take a little step in the direction of steepest descent you would do that then look around take another step and so on and if you started just a couple steps to the right gradient descent would have taken you to this second local optimum over on the right so if you have started this first point you would have wondered about this local optima but you started just a little bit slightly different location you would have wound up at a very different local optimum and this is a property of gradients in that will stay a little bit more about later so that's the intuition in pictures let's look at the map this is the definition of the gradient descent algorithm we're going to just repeat the Li do this until converging so we're going to update my parameter theta J by you know taking theta J and subtracting from it alpha at times this term over here okay so let's see a lot of details in this equation so let me unpack some of it first this notation here R colon equals going to use colon equals to denote assignment so the assignment operator so concretely if I write a colon equals B what this means is it means eel in a computer this means take the value in B and use it to overwrite whatever value is in so this means zero set a to be equal to the value of B it's its assignment and I can also do a colon equals a plus one this means take a and increase this value by one whereas in contrast if I use the equal sign then I write a equals B then this is a truth assertion okay so if I write a equals B then I'm asserting that the value of a equals to the value of B right so the left hand side that's the computer operation where you set the value of a to new value the right hand side this is asserting I'm just making a claim that the values of a and B are the same and so whereas I can write a colon equals a plus 1/10 is increment a by 1 hopefully I won't ever write a equals a plus 1 because this is wrong write a and a plus 1 can never be equal to the same values okay so there's the first part of the definition um this alpha here is a is a number that is called the learning rate and what alpha does is it basically controls how big a step we take downhill with creating descent so if alpha is very large then that corresponds to a very aggressive gradient descent procedure when we're trying to take huge steps downhill and if alpha is very small then we're taking little baby steps downhill and I'll come back and say more about this later about how to set alpha and so on and finally this term here that's a derivative term I don't want to talk about it right now but I will derive this derivative term and tell you exactly what this is later okay and some of you will be more familiar with calculus in others but even if you aren't familiar with calculus don't worry about it I'll tell you what you need to know about this term here now there's one more subtlety about gradient descent which is ingrained in descent we're going to update you know theta zero and theta one right so this update takes place for J equals zero and J equals ones you can update J theta zero and update theta one and the subtlety of how you implement gradient descent is for this expression right for this update equation you want to simultaneously update theta 0 and theta 1 what I mean by that is that you know in this equation we're going to update theta 0 co 2 equals theta 0 minus something and update theta 1 code equals theta 1 minus something and the way to implement is is you should compute the right hand side right compute that thing for theta 0 and theta 1 and then simultaneously at the same time update theta 0 and theta 1 okay so let me say what I mean by that this is a correct implementation of written meaning on simultaneous updates I'm going to set 10 0 equals at set 10 1 equals that so the basic computer right hand sides and then having computed the right hand sides and store them in two variables x 0 and temp 1 I'm going to year update theta 0 and theta 1 simultaneously that's a correct implementation in contrast here's an incorrect implementation that does not do a simultaneous update so in this incorrect implementation we compute 10 0 and then we update theta 0 let me compute tenth one and then we update 10 1 and the difference between the right hand side and the left hand side implementations is that if you look down here you look at this step if by this time you've already updated theta zero then you would be using the new value of theta 0 you know to compute this derivative term and so this gives you a different value of 10 1 then the left hand side right because you've now plugged in the new value of theta 0 into this equation and so this on the right hand side is not a correct implementation of gradient descent ok so I don't want to say why you need to do the simultaneous updates so it turns out that you know the way gradient descent is usually implemented we say more but later it actually turns out to be more natural to implement the simultaneous updates and when people talk about gradient descent they always mean simultaneous update if you implement the non simultaneous update it turns out it will probably work anyway but this is this album on the right is not what people refer to as free ascent and this is some other algorithm with different properties and for various reasons this behaves can behave and slightly stranger ways and so you know what you should do is really implement the simultaneous update of gradient descent so that's the outline of the gradient descent algorithm in the next video we're going to go into the details of the derivative term which I wrote I'll back didn't really define and if you take the calculus class before and if you're familiar with partial derivatives and derivatives it turns out that's exactly what that derivative term is but in case you aren't familiar of calculus don't worry about it the next video will give you all the intuitions and will tell you everything you need to know to compute that derivative term even if you haven't seen calculus or even you haven't seen partial derivatives before and with that with the next video hopefully we'll really give you all the intuitions you need to apply gradient descent\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others. Core concepts related to  information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\\nCryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names \\\"Alice\\\" (or \\\"A\\\") for the sender, \\\"Bob\\\" (or \\\"B\\\") for the intended recipient, and \\\"Eve\\\" (or \\\"E\\\") for the eavesdropping adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.\\nModern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed \\\"computationally secure\\\". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\\nThe growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nThe first use of the term \\\"cryptograph\\\" (as opposed to \\\"cryptogram\\\") dates back to the 19th century\\u2014originating from \\\"The Gold-Bug\\\", a story by Edgar Allan Poe.Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to \\\"encryption\\\", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into an unintelligible form (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a \\\"key\\\". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a string of characters (ideally short so it can be remembered by the user), which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext.  In formal mathematical terms, a \\\"cryptosystem\\\" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key.  Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks.\\nThere are two main types of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems. Asymmetric systems use a \\\"public key\\\" to encrypt a message and a related \\\"private key\\\" to decrypt it. The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key.  In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key, and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key. Examples of asymmetric systems include Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange, RSA (Rivest\\u2013Shamir\\u2013Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and Post-quantum cryptography. Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data Encryption Standard).  Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as Pig Latin or other cant, and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the one-time pad early in the 20th century.\\nIn colloquial use, the term \\\"code\\\" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a code word (for example, \\\"wallaby\\\" replaces \\\"attack at dawn\\\").  A cypher, in contrast, is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable, or a pair of letters, etc.) in order to produce a cyphertext.\\nCryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to \\\"crack\\\" encryption algorithms or their implementations.\\nSome use the terms \\\"cryptography\\\" and \\\"cryptology\\\" interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use \\\"cryptography\\\" to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and \\\"cryptology\\\" to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis. English is more flexible than several other languages in which \\\"cryptology\\\" (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. RFC 2828 advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptology.The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called cryptolinguistics. Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nBefore the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)\\u2014conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.\\n\\n\\n=== Classic cryptography ===\\nThe main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and substitution ciphers, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet). Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (c.\\u20091900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.\\nThe Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. Other steganography methods involve 'hiding in plain sight,' such as using a music cipher to disguise an encrypted message within a regular piece of sheet music. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.\\nIn India, the 2000-year-old Kamasutra of V\\u0101tsy\\u0101yana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.In Sassanid Persia, there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author Ibn al-Nadim: the \\u0161\\u0101h-dab\\u012br\\u012bya (literally \\\"King's script\\\") which was used for official correspondence, and the r\\u0101z-sahar\\u012bya which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.David Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs, the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. Al-Khalil (717\\u2013786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.\\nCiphertexts produced by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see cryptogram). Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.\\nLanguage letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.\\nEssentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the Vigen\\u00e8re cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigen\\u00e8re cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim\\u2014'the enemy knows the system'.\\nDifferent physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher. In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines\\u2014famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.\\n\\n\\n=== Early computer-era cryptography ===\\nCryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitive tasks, such as military code breaking (decryption). This culminated in the development of the Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.\\nExtensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent, beginning in the mid-1970s. In the early 1970s IBM personnel designed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the United States. In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange algorithm. In 1977 the RSA algorithm was published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column. Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\\nSome modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable, such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems, so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics. There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The one-time pad is one, and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that RSA is secure, and some other systems, but even so, proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers.  There are systems similar to RSA, such as one by Michael O. Rabin that are provably secure provided factoring  n = pq is impossible;  it is quite unusable in practice. The discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.As well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential impact of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography. The announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.\\n\\n\\n=== Modern cryptography ===\\nPrior to the early 20th century, cryptography was mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns. Since then cryptography has broadened in scope, and now makes extensive use of mathematical subdisciplines, including information theory, computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics. Cryptography is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition; other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics.\\nJust as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\\n\\n\\n== Modern cryptography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Symmetric-key cryptography ===\\n\\nSymmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.\\nSymmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher.\\nThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted). Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption to e-mail privacy and secure remote access. Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.Stream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the one-time pad. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. RC4 is a widely used stream cipher. Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers by generating blocks of a keystream (in place of a Pseudorandom number generator) and applying an XOR operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystream.Message authentication codes (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms, and so has been thought worth the effort. Cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output a short, fixed-length hash, which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \\\"prudent\\\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \\\"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\\\" Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\\n\\n\\n=== Public-key cryptography ===\\n\\nSymmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret.\\n\\nIn a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used\\u2014a public key and a private key. A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as \\\"the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance\\\".In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the public key is used for encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key.\\nThe X.509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificates.Diffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. This race was finally won in 1978 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, whose solution has since become known as the RSA algorithm.The Diffie\\u2013Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high-quality public-key algorithms, have been among the most widely used. Other asymmetric-key algorithms include the Cramer\\u2013Shoup cryptosystem, ElGamal encryption, and various elliptic curve techniques.A document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments. Reportedly, around 1970, James H. Ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, Clifford Cocks invented a solution that was very similar in design rationale to RSA. In 1974, Malcolm J. Williamson is claimed to have developed the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange.\\nPublic-key cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to forge. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for signing, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for verification, in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and DSA are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes (e.g., SSL/TLS, many VPNs, etc.).Public-key algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of \\\"hard\\\" problems, often from number theory. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the integer factorization problem, while Diffie\\u2013Hellman and DSA are related to the discrete logarithm problem. The security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as modular multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptographic hash functions ===\\nCryptographic hash functions are functions that take a variable-length input and return a fixed-length output, which can be used in, for example, a digital signature. For a hash function to be secure, it must be difficult to compute two inputs that hash to the same value (collision resistance) and to compute an input that hashes to a given output (preimage resistance). MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \\\"prudent\\\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \\\"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\\\" Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptanalysis ===\\n\\nThe goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.\\nIt is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message. Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., \\\"work factor\\\", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher. Although well-implemented one-time-pad encryption cannot be broken, traffic analysis is still possible.\\nThere are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts. Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient. Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved).\\n\\nCryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks.\\nPublic-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithms, both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time (P) using only a classical Turing-complete computer. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P that can solve these problems, or using other technologies, such as quantum computers. For instance, the best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best-known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, to achieve an equivalent strength of encryption, techniques that depend upon the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, such as the RSA cryptosystem, require larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.\\nWhile pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called side-channel attacks. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, they may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. Social engineering and other attacks against humans (e.g., bribery, extortion, blackmail, espionage, rubber-hose cryptanalysis or torture) are usually employed due to being more cost-effective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptographic primitives ===\\nMuch of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives\\u2014algorithms with basic cryptographic properties\\u2014and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note, however, that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptosystems ===\\n\\nOne or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected backup data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols.\\nSome widely known cryptosystems include RSA, Schnorr signature, ElGamal encryption, and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). More complex cryptosystems include electronic cash systems, signcryption systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical' cryptosystems include interactive proof systems, (like zero-knowledge proofs) and systems for secret sharing,.\\n\\n\\n=== Lightweight cryptography ===\\nLightweight cryptography (LWC) concerns cryptographic algorithms developed for a strictly constrained environment. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithms that are better suited for the environment. An IoT environment requires strict constraints on power consumption, processing power, and security. Algorithms such as PRESENT, AES, and SPECK are examples of the many LWC algorithms that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n\\nCryptography is widely used on the internet to help protect user-data and prevent eavesdropping. To ensure secrecy during transmission, many systems use private key cryptography to protect transmitted information. With public-key systems, one can maintain secrecy without a master key or a large number of keys. But, some algorithms like Bitlocker and Veracrypt are generally not private-public key cryptography. For example, Veracrypt uses a password hash to generate the single private key. However, it can be configured to run in public-private key systems. The C++ opensource encryption library OpenSSL provides free and opensource encryption software and tools. The most commonly used encryption cipher suit is AES, as it has hardware acceleration for all x86 based processors that has AES-NI. A close contender is ChaCha20-Poly1305, which is a stream cipher, however it is commonly used for mobile devices as they are ARM based which does not feature AES-NI instruction set extension.\\n\\n\\n=== Cybersecurity ===\\nCryptography can be used to secure communications by encrypting them. Websites use encryption via HTTPS. \\\"End-to-end\\\" encryption, where only sender and receiver can read messages, is implemented for email in Pretty Good Privacy and for secure messaging in general in WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.Operating systems use encryption to keep passwords secret, conceal parts of the system, and ensure that software updates are truly from the system maker. Instead of storing plaintext passwords, computer systems store hashes thereof; then, when a user logs in, the system passes the given password through a cryptographic hash function and compares it to the hashed value on file. In this manner, neither the system nor an attacker has at any point access to the password in plaintext.Encryption is sometimes used to encrypt one's entire drive. For example, University College London has implemented BitLocker (a program by Microsoft) to render drive data opaque without users logging in.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics ===\\nCryptographic techniques enable cryptocurrency technologies, such as distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchains), which finance cryptoeconomics applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi). Key cryptographic techniques that enable cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics include, but are not limited to: cryptographic keys, cryptographic hash function, asymmetric (public key) encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).\\n\\n\\n== Legal issues ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prohibitions ===\\nCryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies. Secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous. Because of its facilitation of privacy, and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high-quality cryptography possible.\\nIn some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, France significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In China and Iran, a license is still required to use cryptography. Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Tunisia, and Vietnam.In the United States, cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography. One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List. Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.\\n\\n\\n=== Export controls ===\\n\\nIn the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed. Daniel J. Bernstein, then a graduate student at UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.In 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the Wassenaar Arrangement, an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and \\\"dual-use\\\" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled. Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000; there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-exported mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include US-sourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via Transport Layer Security). The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook E-mail client programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with S/MIME. Many Internet users do not realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally do not find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.\\n\\n\\n=== NSA involvement ===\\n\\nAnother contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy. The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography. DES was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis, a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s. According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis, but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.\\nAnother instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement (i.e. wiretapping).\\n\\n\\n=== Digital rights management ===\\n\\nCryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes. This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.\\nThe United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA. Cryptologist Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security. Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the Motion Picture Association of America sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.\\n\\n\\n=== Forced disclosure of encryption keys ===\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security. Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009, resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment. Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.\\nIn the United States, the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the Fifth Amendment. In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.In many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.\\nThe 2016 FBI\\u2013Apple encryption dispute concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.\\nAs a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability, where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a drive which has been securely wiped).\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Python Dictionaries\\nthisdict = {\\n  \\\"brand\\\": \\\"Ford\\\",\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"Mustang\\\",\\n  \\\"year\\\": 1964\\n}\\nDictionary\\nDictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\\n\\nA dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\\n\\nAs of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.

Further, a point where the gradient is the zero vector is known as a stationary point. The gradient thus plays a fundamental role in optimization theory, where it is used to maximize a function by gradient ascent.

There can be functions for which partial derivatives exist in every direction but fail to be differentiable. \\nFor example, the function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        ,\\n        y\\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                x\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              y\\n            \\n            \\n              \\n                x\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              +\\n              \\n                y\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(x,y)={\\\\frac {x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}}\\n   unless at origin where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        0\\n        ,\\n        0\\n        )\\n        =\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(0,0)=0}\\n  , is not differentiable at the origin as it does not have a well defined tangent plane despite having well defined partial derivatives in every direction at the origin. In this particular example, under rotation of x-y coordinate system, the above formula for gradient fails to transform like a vector (gradient becomes dependent on choice of basis for coordinate system) and also fails to point towards the 'steepest ascent' in some orientations. For differentiable functions where the formula for gradient holds, it can be shown to always transform as a vector under transformation of the basis so as to always point towards the fastest increase.\\nThe gradient is dual to the total derivative \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        d\\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle df}\\n  : the value of the gradient at a point is a tangent vector \\u2013 a vector at each point; while the value of the derivative at a point is a cotangent vector \\u2013 a linear functional on vectors.

At each point in the room, the gradient of T at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly, moving away from (x, y, z). The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.\\nConsider a surface whose height above sea level at point (x, y) is H(x, y). The gradient of H at a point is a plane vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector.\\nThe gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a dot product. Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40%. A road going directly uphill has slope 40%, but a road going around the hill at an angle will have a shallower slope. For example, if the road is at a 60\\u00b0 angle from the uphill direction (when both directions are projected onto the horizontal plane), then the slope along the road will be the dot product between the gradient vector and a unit vector along the road, as the dot product measures how much the unit vector along the road aligns with the steepest slope, which is 40% times the cosine of 60\\u00b0, or 20%.\\nMore generally, if the hill height function H is differentiable, then the gradient of H dotted with a unit vector gives the slope of the hill in the direction of the vector, the directional derivative of H along the unit vector.\\n\\n\\n== Notation ==\\nThe gradient of a function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n   at point \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n   is usually written as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\u2207\\n        f\\n        (\\n        a\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla f(a)}\\n  .

The gradient of f is defined as the unique vector field whose dot product with any vector v at each point x is the directional derivative of f along v. That is,\\n\\nwhere the right-hand side is the directional derivative and there are many ways to represent it. Formally, the derivative is dual to the gradient; see relationship with derivative.\\nWhen a function also depends on a parameter such as time, the gradient often refers simply to the vector of its spatial derivatives only (see Spatial gradient).\\nThe magnitude and direction of the gradient vector are independent of the particular coordinate representation.\\n\\n\\n=== Cartesian coordinates ===\\nIn the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with a Euclidean metric, the gradient, if it exists, is given by\\n\\nwhere i, j, k are the standard unit vectors in the directions of the x, y and z coordinates, respectively.

Thus \\u2207f is a function from U to the space Rn such that\\n\\nwhere \\u00b7 is the dot product.\\nAs a consequence, the usual properties of the derivative hold for the gradient, though the gradient is not a derivative itself, but rather dual to the derivative:\\n\\nLinearity\\nThe gradient is linear in the sense that if f and g are two real-valued functions differentiable at the point a \\u2208 Rn, and \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 are two constants, then \\u03b1f + \\u03b2g is differentiable at a, and moreover \\nProduct rule\\nIf f and g are real-valued functions differentiable at a point a \\u2208 Rn, then the product rule asserts that the product fg is differentiable at a, and \\nChain rule\\nSuppose that f : A \\u2192 R is a real-valued function defined on a subset A of Rn, and that f is differentiable at a point a. There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function g is a parametric curve; that is, a function g : I \\u2192 Rn maps a subset I \\u2282 R into Rn. If g is differentiable at a point c \\u2208 I such that g(c) = a, then  where \\u2218 is the composition operator: (f\\u2009\\u2218\\u2009g)(x) = f(g(x)).More generally, if instead I \\u2282 Rk, then the following holds:\\n\\nwhere (Dg)T denotes the transpose Jacobian matrix.\\nFor the second form of the chain rule, suppose that h : I \\u2192 R is a real valued function on a subset I of R, and that h is differentiable at the point f(a) \\u2208 I. Then\\n\\n\\n== Further properties and applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Level sets ===\\n\\nA level surface, or isosurface, is the set of all points where some function has a given value.\\nIf f is differentiable, then the dot product (\\u2207f\\u2009)x \\u22c5 v of the gradient at a point x with a vector v gives the directional derivative of f at x in the direction v. It follows that in this case the gradient of f is orthogonal to the level sets of f. For example, a level surface in three-dimensional space is defined by an equation of the form F(x, y, z) = c. The gradient of F is then normal to the surface.\\nMore generally, any embedded hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold can be cut out by an equation of the form F(P) = 0 such that dF is nowhere zero. The gradient of F is then normal to the hypersurface.\\nSimilarly, an affine algebraic hypersurface may be defined by an equation F(x1, ..., xn) = 0, where F is a polynomial. The gradient of F is zero at a singular point of the hypersurface (this is the definition of a singular point). At a non-singular point, it is a nonzero normal vector.\\n\\n\\n=== Conservative vector fields and the gradient theorem ===\\n\\nThe gradient of a function is called a gradient field. A (continuous) gradient field is always a conservative vector field: its line integral along any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, and can be evaluated by the gradient theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals). Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function.\\n\\n\\n== Generalizations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Jacobian ===\\n\\nThe Jacobian matrix is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and differentiable maps between Euclidean spaces or, more generally, manifolds.

CrashCourse Computer Science! Over the past two episodes, we\\u2019ve talked a lot about computer security. But the fact is, there\\u2019s no such thing as a perfectly, 100% secure, computer system. There will always be bugs and security experts know that. So system architects employ a strategy called defence in depth, which uses many layers of varying security mechanisms to frustrate attackers. It\\u2019s a bit like how castles are designed \\u2013 first you\\u2019ve got to dodge the archers, then cross the moat, scale the walls, avoid the hot oil, get over the ramparts, and defeat the guards before you get to the throne room, but in this case we\\u2019re talking about one of the most common forms of computer security - Cryptography. INTRO The word cryptography comes from the roots \\u2018crypto\\u2019 and \\u2018graphy\\u2019, roughly translating to \\u201csecret writing\\u201d. In order to make information secret, you use a cipher \\u2013 an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext, which is gibberish unless you have a key that lets you undo the cipher. The process of making text secret is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption. Ciphers have been used long before computers showed up. Julius Caesar used what\\u2019s now called a Caesar cipher, to encrypt private correspondence. He would shift the letters in a message forward by three places. So, A became D, and the word \\\"brutus\\\" became this: \\\"euxwxv\\\". To decipher the message, recipients had to know both the algorithm and the number to shift by, which acted as the key. The Caesar cipher is one example of a larger class of techniques called substitution ciphers. These replace every letter in a message with something else according to a translation. A big drawback of basic substitution ciphers is that letter frequencies are preserved. For example, E is the most common letter in English, so if your cipher translates E to an X, then X will show up the most frequently in the ciphertext. A skilled cryptanalyst can work backwards from these kinds of statistics to figure out the message. Indeed, it was the breaking of a substitution cipher that led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 for plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth. Another fundamental class of techniques are permutation ciphers. Let\\u2019s look at a simple example, called a columnar transposition cipher. Here, we take a message, and fill the letters into a grid. In this case, we\\u2019ve chosen 5 by 5. To encrypt our message, we read out the characters in a different order, let\\u2019s say from the bottom left, working upwards, one column at a time. The new letter ordering, what\\u2019s called a permutation, is the encrypted message. The ordering direction, as well as the 5 by 5 grid size, serves as the key. Like before, if the cipher and key are known, a recipient can reverse the process to reveal the original message. By the 1900s, cryptography was mechanized in the form of encryption machines. The most famous was the German Enigma, used by the Nazis to encrypt their wartime communications. As we discussed back in Episode 15, the Enigma was a typewriter-like machine, with a keyboard and lampboard, both showing the full alphabet. Above that, there was a series of configurable rotors that were the key to the Enigma\\u2019s encryption capability. First, let\\u2019s look at just one rotor. One side had electrical contacts for all 26 letters. These connected to the other side of the rotor using cross-crossing wires that swapped one letter for another. If \\u2018H\\u2019 went in, \\u2018K\\u2019 might come out the other side. If \\u201cK\\u2019 went in, \\u2018F\\u2019 might come out, and so on. This letter swapping behavior should sound familiar: it\\u2019s a substitution cipher! But, the Enigma was more sophisticated because it used three or more rotors in a row, each feeding into the next. Rotors could also be rotated to one of 26 possible starting positions, and they could be inserted in different orders, providing a lot of different substitution mappings. Following the rotors was a special circuit called a reflector. Instead of passing the signal on to another rotor, it connected every pin to another, and sent the electrical signal back through the rotors. Finally, there was a plugboard at the front of the machine that allowed letters coming from the keyboard to be optionally swapped, adding another level of complexity. With our simplified circuit, let\\u2019s encrypt a letter on this example enigma configuration. If we press the \\u2018H\\u2019 key, electricity flows through the plugboard, then the rotors, hits the reflector, comes back through the rotors and plugboard, and illuminates the letter \\u2018L\\u2019 on the lampboard. So H is encrypted to L. Note that the circuit can flow both ways \\u2013 so if we typed the letter \\u2018L\\u2019, \\u2018H\\u2019 would light up. In other words, it\\u2019s the same process for encrypting and decrypting; you just have to make sure the sending and receiving machines have the same initial configuration. If you look carefully at this circuit, you\\u2019ll notice it\\u2019s impossible for a letter to be encrypted as itself, which turned out to be a fatal cryptographic weakness. Finally, to prevent the Enigma from being a simple substitution cipher, every single time a letter was entered, the rotors advanced by one spot, sort of like an odometer in a car. So if you entered the text A-A-A, it might come out as B-D-K, where the substitution mapping changed with every key press. The Enigma was a tough cookie to crack, for sure. But as we discussed in Episode 15, Alan Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park were able to break Enigma codes and largely automate the process. But with the advent of computers, cryptography moved from hardware into software. One of the earliest software ciphers to become widespread was the Data Encryption Standard developed by IBM and the NSA in 1977. DES, as it was known, originally used binary keys that were 56 bits long, which means that there are 2 to the 56, or about 72 quadrillion different keys. Back in 1977, that meant that nobody \\u2013 except perhaps the NSA \\u2013 had enough computing power to brute-force all possible keys. But, by 1999, a quarter-million dollar computer could try every possible DES key in just two days, rendering the cipher insecure. So, in 2001, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was finalized and published. AES is designed to use much bigger keys \\u2013 128, 192 or 256 bits in size \\u2013 making brute force attacks much, much harder. For a 128-bit keys, you'd need trillions of years to try every combination, even if you used every single computer on the planet today. So you better get started! AES chops data up into 16-byte blocks, and then applies a series of substitutions and permutations, based on the key value, plus some other operations to obscure the message, and this process is repeated ten or more times for each block. You might be wondering: why only ten rounds? Or why only 128 bit keys, and not ten thousand bit keys? Well, it\\u2019s a performance tradeoff. If it took hours to encrypt and send an email, or minutes to connect to a secure website, people wouldn't use it. AES balances performance and security to provide practical cryptography. Today, AES is used everywhere, from encrypting files on iPhones and transmitting data over WiFi with WPA2, to accessing websites using HTTPS. So far, the cryptographic techniques we\\u2019ve discussed rely on keys that are known by both sender and recipient. The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key. In the old days, keys would be shared by voice, or physically; for example, the Germans distributed codebooks with daily settings for their Enigma machines. But this strategy could never work in the internet era. Imagine having to crack open a codebook to connect to youtube! What\\u2019s needed is a way for a server to send a secret key over the public internet to a user wishing to connect securely. It seems like that wouldn\\u2019t be secure, because if the key is sent in the open and intercepted by a hacker, couldn\\u2019t they use that to decrypt all communication between the two? The solution is key exchange! \\u2013 An algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one. We can do this with one-way functions \\u2013 mathematical operations that are very easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse. To show you how one-way functions work, let\\u2019s use paint colors as an analogy. It\\u2019s easy to mix paint colors together, but it\\u2019s not so easy to figure out the constituent colors that were used to make a mixed paint color. You\\u2019d have to test a lot of possibilities to figure it out. In this metaphor, our secret key is a unique shade of paint. First, there\\u2019s a public paint color that everyone can see. Then, John and I each pick a secret paint color. To exchange keys, I mix my secret paint color with the public paint color. Then, I send that mixed color to John by any means \\u2013 mail, carrier pigeon, whatever. John does the same \\u2013 mixing his secret paint color with the public color, then sending that to me. When I receive John\\u2019s color, I simply add my private color to create a blend of all three paints. John does the same with my mixed color. And Voila! We both end up with the same paint color! We can use this as a shared secret, even though we never sent each other our individual secret colors. A snooping outside observer would know partial information, but they\\u2019d find it very difficult to figure out our shared secret color. Of course, sending and mixing paint colors isn\\u2019t going to work well for transmitting computer data. But luckily, mathematical one-way functions are perfect, and this is what Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange uses. In Diffie-Hellman, the one-way function is modular exponentiation. This means taking one number, the base, to the power of another number, the exponent, and taking the remainder when dividing by a third number, the modulus. So, for example, if we wanted to calculate 3 to the 5th power, modulo 31, we would calculate 3 to the 5th, which is 243, then take the remainder when divided by 31, which is 26. The hard part is figuring out the exponent given only the result and the base. If I tell you I raised 3 to some secret number, modulo 31, and got 7 as the remainder, you'd have to test a lot of exponents to know which one I picked. If we make these numbers big, say hundreds of digits long, then finding the secret exponent is nearly impossible. Now let\\u2019s talk about how Diffie-Hellman uses modular exponentiation to calculate a shared key. First, there's a set of public values \\u2013 the base and the modulus, that, like our public paint color, everyone gets to know... even the bad guys! To send a message securely to John, I would pick a secret exponent: X. Then, I\\u2019d calculate B to the power of X, modulo M. I send this big number over to John. John does the same, picking a secret exponent Y, and sending me B to the Y modulo M. To create a shared secret key, I take what John sent me, and take it to the power of X, my secret exponent. This is mathematically equivalent to B to the XY modulus M. John does the same, taking what I sent to him to the power of Y, and we both end up with the exact same number! It\\u2019s a secret shared key, even though we never sent each other our secret number. We can use this big number as a shared key for encrypted communication, using something like AES for encryption. Diffie-Hellman key exchange is one method for establishing a shared key. These keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides. The Caesar Cipher, Enigma and AES are all symmetric encryption. There\\u2019s also asymmetric encryption, where there are two different keys, most often one that\\u2019s public and another that\\u2019s private. So, people can encrypt a message using a public key that only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt. In other words, knowing the public key only lets you encrypt, but not decrypt \\u2013 it\\u2019s asymmetric! So, think about boxes with padlocks that you can open with a key. To receive a secure message, I can give a sender a box and padlock. They put their message in it and lock it shut. Now, they can send that box back to me and only I can open it, with my private key. After locking the box, neither the sender, nor anyone else who finds the box, can open it without brute force. In the same way, a digital public key can encrypt something that can only be decrypted with a private key. The reverse is possible too: encrypting something with a private key that can be decrypted with a public key. This is used for signing, where a server encrypts data using their private key. Anyone can decrypt it using the server's public key. This acts like an unforgeable signature, as only the owner, using their private key, can encrypt. It proves that you're getting data from the right server or person, and not an imposter. The most popular asymmetric encryption technique used today is RSA, named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. So, now you know all the \\u201ckey\\u201d parts of modern cryptography: symmetric encryption, key exchange and public-key cryptography. When you connect to a secure website, like your bank, that little padlock icon means that your computer has used public key cryptography to verify the server, key exchange to establish a secret temporary key, and symmetric encryption to protect all the back-and-forth communication from prying eyes. Whether you're buying something online, sending emails to BFFs, or just browsing cat videos, cryptography keeps all that safe, private and secure. Thanks cryptography!\",\n          \"Dictionaries are mappings from key objects to value objects. Dictionaries consists of Key:Value pairs, where the keys must be immutable and the values can be anything. Dictionaries themselves are mutable so this means once you create your dictionary, you can modify its contents on the fly. Dictionaries can be used for performing very fast look-ups on unordered data. A key aspect to be aware about regarding dictionaries is that they are not sequences, and therefore do not maintain any type of left-right order. This means that if you&#39;re looping over a dictionary, the Key:Value pairs will be iterated over in arbitrary order. Let&#39;s look at a diagram to clarify this idea. We&#39;re going to set up a simple dictionary where we have our first key that&#39;s associated with a value object. We have our second key that goes with another object. And let&#39;s say we have key number four here which goes with the corresponding value object. If this is a dictionary, this key object will always be associated with this value object. Similarly, this key will always go with this value object. When we say that dictionaries don&#39;t maintain any type of left or right order, what we&#39;re saying is that the ordering of these key-value pairs themselves is not defined. That means if I&#39;m looping over these pairs, I might first get the pair that corresponds to my second key here. Let&#39;s then look at some uses of dictionaries. I would like to set up a dictionary which is called age. And if I want this to be an empty dictionary, I have two ways to construct that. The first approach is just to use a pair of curly braces, and this would give me a dictionary age which would be empty at the time of construction. Another possibility is to type &quot;age = dict&quot;, which is a key word, open and close parentheses. And again I have created an empty dictionary. Let&#39;s then construct a dictionary that consists of names and ages. In this particular dictionary, the names are going to be the keys and the ages are going to be the value objects. Imagine the first task we&#39;d like to do is look up a person&#39;s age. We do this using the following syntax. We first type the name of the dictionary. We then follow with the square brackets. Inside the square brackets, we insert the key we&#39;re interested in looking up. Let&#39;s say, in this case, we&#39;d like to know, how old is Pam? So we&#39;d enter &quot;Pam&quot; inside the square brackets. And Python returns the result to us. Often, we&#39;d like to modify the value objects that are associated with specific keys. Let&#39;s say we would like to increase the age of Tim by one year. Here is how we could do this. We first take our age dictionary. We&#39;d like to modify Tim. And let&#39;s say we want to increase his age by one year. We could use the following kind of syntax. We could say age of Tim is equal to age of Tim plus 1. And this certainly works. However incrementing the value of an object by one, or by some other number, is a very common operation. And there&#39;s a very handy shorthand notation for doing that in Python. So let&#39;s take the age of Tim, and say we would like to increase that by one year, we can do the following: We can just type &quot;+= 1&quot;. And what happens if we check the age of Tim, we will have increased Tim age again by one year. Let&#39;s make sure we understand what happens when we say plus equals. When you&#39;re reading code from left to right, the plus operation happens first. Then we have the equal sign, which means assignment. So when we say something plus equals 1, for example, we first take the value of the object, we add one to that object, and then we reassign it back to the original object. A common mistake is sometimes to mix up the order of these two operations. Think about what happens if you say x equals plus 1. You&#39;re not incrementing the value of x by 1. Instead, you&#39;re saying that x should be assigned the value of plus 1, which is just the same thing as saying x is equal to 1. If you wish to increment the value of a variable by 1, you first do it the incrementation and then the assignment. That&#39;s why the order of these two operations is plus and then equals. You can use the dictionary method keys to find out what are all the keys in the dictionary. And similarly, you can use the values method to find out what are all of the values in the dictionary. When you call these methods, Python returns to you an object which has a very special type. The type of the returned object is what&#39;s called a &quot;view object&quot;. View objects do precisely what you might imagine that they do. They provide a dynamic view of the keys or values in the dictionary. A key point here is that as you update or modify your dictionary, the views will also change correspondingly. Let&#39;s now work with the dictionary that we just defined. We&#39;re going to first extract all of the names in the dictionary. So I&#39;ll do that by saying &quot;names = age.keys&quot;. Now let&#39;s just check the type of the object names. And Python confirms that this is a dictionary keys object. Let&#39;s say I would like to add a new key to my dictionary. Let&#39;s add a person called Tom who is 50 in our dictionary. So we say age[&quot;Tom&quot;] and we assign the value object 50 to that key. If we now ask, what are the names, you&#39;ll see that the view object also contains Tom. We didn&#39;t redefine the content of names, and this is the nature of view object. As we modify the dictionary, the content of the view object will change automatically. Let&#39;s look at the values method. So if we say age.values, Python returns to us all of the values in the dictionary. I&#39;m going to call this ages, and we can look at that object. So in this case, we have one, two, three, four, five different ages contained in the dictionary. I&#39;m going to add one more person to the dictionary. Let&#39;s call that person Nick, and let&#39;s say Nick is 31 years old. If I now ask Python, what are the names, you&#39;ll see that the name Nick is also contained in the names object. This is the nature of views objects-- their content is dynamically updated as you modify your dictionary. Finally, let&#39;s see how we&#39;ll test for membership in a dictionary. We know that we have a key Tom in our dictionary. If I want to ask if Tom is a member of our dictionary, if Tom is a key in our dictionary, I can ask, &quot;Tom&quot; in age? And the answer is going to be &quot;True&quot;. If I ask, is &quot;Zofia&quot; in our dictionary? Python is going to say &quot;False&quot;. This is how we test for object membership in a dictionary.\",\n          \"we previously defined the cost function J in this video I want to tell you about an algorithm called gradient descent for minimizing the cost function J it turns out gradient descent is a more general algorithm and is used not only in linear regression is actually used all over the place in machine learning and later in the class we'll use gradient descent to minimize other functions as well not just the cost function J for linear regression so in this video I'm going to talk about gradient descent for minimizing some arbitrary function J and then in later videos we'll take those algorithm and apply it specifically to the cost function J that we had defined for linear regression so here's the problem setup going to assume that we have some function J of theta 0 comma theta 1 maybe as a cost function from linear regression maybe it's some other function we want to minimize and we want to come over now algorithm for minimizing that as a function of j of theta0 theta1 just as an aside it turns out that gradient descent actually applies to more general functions so imagine if you have a function that's a function of j OS theta 0 theta 1 theta 2 up to say something that N and you want to minimize theta 0 you minimize over theta0 up to theta n of this J of theta 0 up to theta n it turns out gradient descent is an algorithm for solving of this more general problem but for the sake of brevity on for the sake of you know succinct ins of notation I'm just going to pretend I have only two parameters throughout the rest of this video here's the idea for gradients then what we're going to do is we're going to start off with some initial guesses for theta 0 and theta 1 doesn't really matter what they are but a common choice will be we set theta 0 to state 0 and set theta 1 to 0 just initialize them to 0 what we're going to do in gradient descent is we'll keep changing theta 0 and say the 1 a little bit they try to reduce J of theta 0 theta 1 until hopefully we wind up at a minimum or maybe a local so let's see what let's see in pictures what gradient descent does let's say you try to minimize this function so notice the axes this is a theta 0 theta 1 on the horizontal axis and J is the vertical axis and so the height of the surface shows J and we want to minimize this function so we're going to start off with theta 0 theta 1 at some point so imagine making some value for theta 0 theta 1 and that corresponds to starting at some points on the surface of this function okay so whatever value of theta 0 theta 1 gives you some point here I didn't initialize them to 0 0 but you know sometimes you neutralize it to other values as well now I want you to imagine that this figure shows a hole imagine this is like the landscape of some draw c-pop with you know two Hills like so and I want you to imagine that you are physically standing at that point on the hill right on this little red node on your Park in gradient descent what we're going to do is we're going to spin 360 degrees around just look all around us and also if I were to take a little baby step in some direction and I want to go downhill as quickly as possible what direction do I take that little baby step in if I want to go down if I sort of want to physically walk down this hill as rapidly as possible turns out that if you're standing at that point on the hill you look all around you find that the best direction to take a little little step downhill is roughly that direction okay and now you have this new point on your hill you're going to again look all around and then say what direction should I step in order to take a little baby step downhill and if you do that and take another step you take a step in that direction and then you keep going you know from this new point you look around taking decide what direction will take you down hill most quickly take another step another step and so on until you converge to this a local minimum down here here the dissenter is an interesting property this first time we ran gradient descent we were starting at this point over here right starts it at that point over here now imagine we have initialized gradient descent just a couple steps to the right imagine with a nationalized gradient descent with that points on the upper right if you were to repeat this process so stop at that point look all around take a little step in the direction of steepest descent you would do that then look around take another step and so on and if you started just a couple steps to the right gradient descent would have taken you to this second local optimum over on the right so if you have started this first point you would have wondered about this local optima but you started just a little bit slightly different location you would have wound up at a very different local optimum and this is a property of gradients in that will stay a little bit more about later so that's the intuition in pictures let's look at the map this is the definition of the gradient descent algorithm we're going to just repeat the Li do this until converging so we're going to update my parameter theta J by you know taking theta J and subtracting from it alpha at times this term over here okay so let's see a lot of details in this equation so let me unpack some of it first this notation here R colon equals going to use colon equals to denote assignment so the assignment operator so concretely if I write a colon equals B what this means is it means eel in a computer this means take the value in B and use it to overwrite whatever value is in so this means zero set a to be equal to the value of B it's its assignment and I can also do a colon equals a plus one this means take a and increase this value by one whereas in contrast if I use the equal sign then I write a equals B then this is a truth assertion okay so if I write a equals B then I'm asserting that the value of a equals to the value of B right so the left hand side that's the computer operation where you set the value of a to new value the right hand side this is asserting I'm just making a claim that the values of a and B are the same and so whereas I can write a colon equals a plus 1/10 is increment a by 1 hopefully I won't ever write a equals a plus 1 because this is wrong write a and a plus 1 can never be equal to the same values okay so there's the first part of the definition um this alpha here is a is a number that is called the learning rate and what alpha does is it basically controls how big a step we take downhill with creating descent so if alpha is very large then that corresponds to a very aggressive gradient descent procedure when we're trying to take huge steps downhill and if alpha is very small then we're taking little baby steps downhill and I'll come back and say more about this later about how to set alpha and so on and finally this term here that's a derivative term I don't want to talk about it right now but I will derive this derivative term and tell you exactly what this is later okay and some of you will be more familiar with calculus in others but even if you aren't familiar with calculus don't worry about it I'll tell you what you need to know about this term here now there's one more subtlety about gradient descent which is ingrained in descent we're going to update you know theta zero and theta one right so this update takes place for J equals zero and J equals ones you can update J theta zero and update theta one and the subtlety of how you implement gradient descent is for this expression right for this update equation you want to simultaneously update theta 0 and theta 1 what I mean by that is that you know in this equation we're going to update theta 0 co 2 equals theta 0 minus something and update theta 1 code equals theta 1 minus something and the way to implement is is you should compute the right hand side right compute that thing for theta 0 and theta 1 and then simultaneously at the same time update theta 0 and theta 1 okay so let me say what I mean by that this is a correct implementation of written meaning on simultaneous updates I'm going to set 10 0 equals at set 10 1 equals that so the basic computer right hand sides and then having computed the right hand sides and store them in two variables x 0 and temp 1 I'm going to year update theta 0 and theta 1 simultaneously that's a correct implementation in contrast here's an incorrect implementation that does not do a simultaneous update so in this incorrect implementation we compute 10 0 and then we update theta 0 let me compute tenth one and then we update 10 1 and the difference between the right hand side and the left hand side implementations is that if you look down here you look at this step if by this time you've already updated theta zero then you would be using the new value of theta 0 you know to compute this derivative term and so this gives you a different value of 10 1 then the left hand side right because you've now plugged in the new value of theta 0 into this equation and so this on the right hand side is not a correct implementation of gradient descent ok so I don't want to say why you need to do the simultaneous updates so it turns out that you know the way gradient descent is usually implemented we say more but later it actually turns out to be more natural to implement the simultaneous updates and when people talk about gradient descent they always mean simultaneous update if you implement the non simultaneous update it turns out it will probably work anyway but this is this album on the right is not what people refer to as free ascent and this is some other algorithm with different properties and for various reasons this behaves can behave and slightly stranger ways and so you know what you should do is really implement the simultaneous update of gradient descent so that's the outline of the gradient descent algorithm in the next video we're going to go into the details of the derivative term which I wrote I'll back didn't really define and if you take the calculus class before and if you're familiar with partial derivatives and derivatives it turns out that's exactly what that derivative term is but in case you aren't familiar of calculus don't worry about it the next video will give you all the intuitions and will tell you everything you need to know to compute that derivative term even if you haven't seen calculus or even you haven't seen partial derivatives before and with that with the next video hopefully we'll really give you all the intuitions you need to apply gradient descent\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others. Core concepts related to  information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\\nCryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names \\\"Alice\\\" (or \\\"A\\\") for the sender, \\\"Bob\\\" (or \\\"B\\\") for the intended recipient, and \\\"Eve\\\" (or \\\"E\\\") for the eavesdropping adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.\\nModern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed \\\"computationally secure\\\". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\\nThe growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nThe first use of the term \\\"cryptograph\\\" (as opposed to \\\"cryptogram\\\") dates back to the 19th century\\u2014originating from \\\"The Gold-Bug\\\", a story by Edgar Allan Poe.Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to \\\"encryption\\\", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into an unintelligible form (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a \\\"key\\\". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a string of characters (ideally short so it can be remembered by the user), which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext.  In formal mathematical terms, a \\\"cryptosystem\\\" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key.  Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks.\\nThere are two main types of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems. Asymmetric systems use a \\\"public key\\\" to encrypt a message and a related \\\"private key\\\" to decrypt it. The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key.  In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key, and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key. Examples of asymmetric systems include Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange, RSA (Rivest\\u2013Shamir\\u2013Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and Post-quantum cryptography. Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data Encryption Standard).  Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as Pig Latin or other cant, and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the one-time pad early in the 20th century.\\nIn colloquial use, the term \\\"code\\\" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a code word (for example, \\\"wallaby\\\" replaces \\\"attack at dawn\\\").  A cypher, in contrast, is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable, or a pair of letters, etc.) in order to produce a cyphertext.\\nCryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to \\\"crack\\\" encryption algorithms or their implementations.\\nSome use the terms \\\"cryptography\\\" and \\\"cryptology\\\" interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use \\\"cryptography\\\" to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and \\\"cryptology\\\" to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis. English is more flexible than several other languages in which \\\"cryptology\\\" (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. RFC 2828 advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptology.The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called cryptolinguistics. Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nBefore the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)\\u2014conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.\\n\\n\\n=== Classic cryptography ===\\nThe main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and substitution ciphers, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet). Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (c.\\u20091900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.\\nThe Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. Other steganography methods involve 'hiding in plain sight,' such as using a music cipher to disguise an encrypted message within a regular piece of sheet music. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.\\nIn India, the 2000-year-old Kamasutra of V\\u0101tsy\\u0101yana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.In Sassanid Persia, there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author Ibn al-Nadim: the \\u0161\\u0101h-dab\\u012br\\u012bya (literally \\\"King's script\\\") which was used for official correspondence, and the r\\u0101z-sahar\\u012bya which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.David Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs, the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. Al-Khalil (717\\u2013786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.\\nCiphertexts produced by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see cryptogram). Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.\\nLanguage letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.\\nEssentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the Vigen\\u00e8re cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigen\\u00e8re cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim\\u2014'the enemy knows the system'.\\nDifferent physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher. In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines\\u2014famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.\\n\\n\\n=== Early computer-era cryptography ===\\nCryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitive tasks, such as military code breaking (decryption). This culminated in the development of the Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.\\nExtensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent, beginning in the mid-1970s. In the early 1970s IBM personnel designed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the United States. In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange algorithm. In 1977 the RSA algorithm was published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column. Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\\nSome modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable, such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems, so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics. There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The one-time pad is one, and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that RSA is secure, and some other systems, but even so, proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers.  There are systems similar to RSA, such as one by Michael O. Rabin that are provably secure provided factoring  n = pq is impossible;  it is quite unusable in practice. The discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.As well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential impact of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography. The announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.\\n\\n\\n=== Modern cryptography ===\\nPrior to the early 20th century, cryptography was mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns. Since then cryptography has broadened in scope, and now makes extensive use of mathematical subdisciplines, including information theory, computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics. Cryptography is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition; other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics.\\nJust as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\\n\\n\\n== Modern cryptography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Symmetric-key cryptography ===\\n\\nSymmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.\\nSymmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher.\\nThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted). Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption to e-mail privacy and secure remote access. Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.Stream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the one-time pad. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. RC4 is a widely used stream cipher. Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers by generating blocks of a keystream (in place of a Pseudorandom number generator) and applying an XOR operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystream.Message authentication codes (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms, and so has been thought worth the effort. Cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output a short, fixed-length hash, which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \\\"prudent\\\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \\\"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\\\" Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\\n\\n\\n=== Public-key cryptography ===\\n\\nSymmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret.\\n\\nIn a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used\\u2014a public key and a private key. A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as \\\"the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance\\\".In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the public key is used for encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key.\\nThe X.509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificates.Diffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. This race was finally won in 1978 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, whose solution has since become known as the RSA algorithm.The Diffie\\u2013Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high-quality public-key algorithms, have been among the most widely used. Other asymmetric-key algorithms include the Cramer\\u2013Shoup cryptosystem, ElGamal encryption, and various elliptic curve techniques.A document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments. Reportedly, around 1970, James H. Ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, Clifford Cocks invented a solution that was very similar in design rationale to RSA. In 1974, Malcolm J. Williamson is claimed to have developed the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange.\\nPublic-key cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to forge. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for signing, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for verification, in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and DSA are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes (e.g., SSL/TLS, many VPNs, etc.).Public-key algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of \\\"hard\\\" problems, often from number theory. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the integer factorization problem, while Diffie\\u2013Hellman and DSA are related to the discrete logarithm problem. The security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as modular multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptographic hash functions ===\\nCryptographic hash functions are functions that take a variable-length input and return a fixed-length output, which can be used in, for example, a digital signature. For a hash function to be secure, it must be difficult to compute two inputs that hash to the same value (collision resistance) and to compute an input that hashes to a given output (preimage resistance). MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \\\"prudent\\\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \\\"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\\\" Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptanalysis ===\\n\\nThe goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.\\nIt is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message. Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., \\\"work factor\\\", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher. Although well-implemented one-time-pad encryption cannot be broken, traffic analysis is still possible.\\nThere are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts. Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient. Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved).\\n\\nCryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks.\\nPublic-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithms, both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time (P) using only a classical Turing-complete computer. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P that can solve these problems, or using other technologies, such as quantum computers. For instance, the best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best-known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, to achieve an equivalent strength of encryption, techniques that depend upon the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, such as the RSA cryptosystem, require larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.\\nWhile pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called side-channel attacks. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, they may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. Social engineering and other attacks against humans (e.g., bribery, extortion, blackmail, espionage, rubber-hose cryptanalysis or torture) are usually employed due to being more cost-effective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptographic primitives ===\\nMuch of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives\\u2014algorithms with basic cryptographic properties\\u2014and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note, however, that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptosystems ===\\n\\nOne or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected backup data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols.\\nSome widely known cryptosystems include RSA, Schnorr signature, ElGamal encryption, and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). More complex cryptosystems include electronic cash systems, signcryption systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical' cryptosystems include interactive proof systems, (like zero-knowledge proofs) and systems for secret sharing,.\\n\\n\\n=== Lightweight cryptography ===\\nLightweight cryptography (LWC) concerns cryptographic algorithms developed for a strictly constrained environment. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithms that are better suited for the environment. An IoT environment requires strict constraints on power consumption, processing power, and security. Algorithms such as PRESENT, AES, and SPECK are examples of the many LWC algorithms that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n\\nCryptography is widely used on the internet to help protect user-data and prevent eavesdropping. To ensure secrecy during transmission, many systems use private key cryptography to protect transmitted information. With public-key systems, one can maintain secrecy without a master key or a large number of keys. But, some algorithms like Bitlocker and Veracrypt are generally not private-public key cryptography. For example, Veracrypt uses a password hash to generate the single private key. However, it can be configured to run in public-private key systems. The C++ opensource encryption library OpenSSL provides free and opensource encryption software and tools. The most commonly used encryption cipher suit is AES, as it has hardware acceleration for all x86 based processors that has AES-NI. A close contender is ChaCha20-Poly1305, which is a stream cipher, however it is commonly used for mobile devices as they are ARM based which does not feature AES-NI instruction set extension.\\n\\n\\n=== Cybersecurity ===\\nCryptography can be used to secure communications by encrypting them. Websites use encryption via HTTPS. \\\"End-to-end\\\" encryption, where only sender and receiver can read messages, is implemented for email in Pretty Good Privacy and for secure messaging in general in WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.Operating systems use encryption to keep passwords secret, conceal parts of the system, and ensure that software updates are truly from the system maker. Instead of storing plaintext passwords, computer systems store hashes thereof; then, when a user logs in, the system passes the given password through a cryptographic hash function and compares it to the hashed value on file. In this manner, neither the system nor an attacker has at any point access to the password in plaintext.Encryption is sometimes used to encrypt one's entire drive. For example, University College London has implemented BitLocker (a program by Microsoft) to render drive data opaque without users logging in.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics ===\\nCryptographic techniques enable cryptocurrency technologies, such as distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchains), which finance cryptoeconomics applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi). Key cryptographic techniques that enable cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics include, but are not limited to: cryptographic keys, cryptographic hash function, asymmetric (public key) encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).\\n\\n\\n== Legal issues ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prohibitions ===\\nCryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies. Secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous. Because of its facilitation of privacy, and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high-quality cryptography possible.\\nIn some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, France significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In China and Iran, a license is still required to use cryptography. Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Tunisia, and Vietnam.In the United States, cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography. One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List. Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.\\n\\n\\n=== Export controls ===\\n\\nIn the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed. Daniel J. Bernstein, then a graduate student at UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.In 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the Wassenaar Arrangement, an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and \\\"dual-use\\\" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled. Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000; there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-exported mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include US-sourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via Transport Layer Security). The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook E-mail client programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with S/MIME. Many Internet users do not realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally do not find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.\\n\\n\\n=== NSA involvement ===\\n\\nAnother contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy. The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography. DES was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis, a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s. According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis, but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.\\nAnother instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement (i.e. wiretapping).\\n\\n\\n=== Digital rights management ===\\n\\nCryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes. This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.\\nThe United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA. Cryptologist Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security. Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the Motion Picture Association of America sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.\\n\\n\\n=== Forced disclosure of encryption keys ===\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security. Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009, resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment. Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.\\nIn the United States, the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the Fifth Amendment. In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.In many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.\\nThe 2016 FBI\\u2013Apple encryption dispute concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.\\nAs a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability, where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a drive which has been securely wiped).\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Python Dictionaries\\nthisdict = {\\n  \\\"brand\\\": \\\"Ford\\\",\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"Mustang\\\",\\n  \\\"year\\\": 1964\\n}\\nDictionary\\nDictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\\n\\nA dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\\n\\nAs of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.

At each point in the room, the gradient of T at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly, moving away from (x, y, z). The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.\\nConsider a surface whose height above sea level at point (x, y) is H(x, y). The gradient of H at a point is a plane vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector.\\nThe gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a dot product. Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40%. A road going directly uphill has slope 40%, but a road going around the hill at an angle will have a shallower slope. For example, if the road is at a 60\\u00b0 angle from the uphill direction (when both directions are projected onto the horizontal plane), then the slope along the road will be the dot product between the gradient vector and a unit vector along the road, as the dot product measures how much the unit vector along the road aligns with the steepest slope, which is 40% times the cosine of 60\\u00b0, or 20%.\\nMore generally, if the hill height function H is differentiable, then the gradient of H dotted with a unit vector gives the slope of the hill in the direction of the vector, the directional derivative of H along the unit vector.\\n\\n\\n== Notation ==\\nThe gradient of a function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n   at point \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n   is usually written as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\u2207\\n        f\\n        (\\n        a\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla f(a)}\\n  .

The notation grad f  is also commonly used to represent the gradient. The gradient of f is defined as the unique vector field whose dot product with any vector v at each point x is the directional derivative of f along v. That is,\\n\\nwhere the right-hand side is the directional derivative and there are many ways to represent it. Formally, the derivative is dual to the gradient; see relationship with derivative.\\nWhen a function also depends on a parameter such as time, the gradient often refers simply to the vector of its spatial derivatives only (see Spatial gradient).\\nThe magnitude and direction of the gradient vector are independent of the particular coordinate representation.\\n\\n\\n=== Cartesian coordinates ===\\nIn the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with a Euclidean metric, the gradient, if it exists, is given by\\n\\nwhere i, j, k are the standard unit vectors in the directions of the x, y and z coordinates, respectively.

Thus \\u2207f is a function from U to the space Rn such that\\n\\nwhere \\u00b7 is the dot product.\\nAs a consequence, the usual properties of the derivative hold for the gradient, though the gradient is not a derivative itself, but rather dual to the derivative:\\n\\nLinearity\\nThe gradient is linear in the sense that if f and g are two real-valued functions differentiable at the point a \\u2208 Rn, and \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 are two constants, then \\u03b1f + \\u03b2g is differentiable at a, and moreover \\nProduct rule\\nIf f and g are real-valued functions differentiable at a point a \\u2208 Rn, then the product rule asserts that the product fg is differentiable at a, and \\nChain rule\\nSuppose that f : A \\u2192 R is a real-valued function defined on a subset A of Rn, and that f is differentiable at a point a. There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function g is a parametric curve; that is, a function g : I \\u2192 Rn maps a subset I \\u2282 R into Rn. If g is differentiable at a point c \\u2208 I such that g(c) = a, then  where \\u2218 is the composition operator: (f\\u2009\\u2218\\u2009g)(x) = f(g(x)).More generally, if instead I \\u2282 Rk, then the following holds:\\n\\nwhere (Dg)T denotes the transpose Jacobian matrix.\\nFor the second form of the chain rule, suppose that h : I \\u2192 R is a real valued function on a subset I of R, and that h is differentiable at the point f(a) \\u2208 I. Then\\n\\n\\n== Further properties and applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Level sets ===\\n\\nA level surface, or isosurface, is the set of all points where some function has a given value.\\nIf f is differentiable, then the dot product (\\u2207f\\u2009)x \\u22c5 v of the gradient at a point x with a vector v gives the directional derivative of f at x in the direction v. It follows that in this case the gradient of f is orthogonal to the level sets of f. For example, a level surface in three-dimensional space is defined by an equation of the form F(x, y, z) = c. The gradient of F is then normal to the surface.\\nMore generally, any embedded hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold can be cut out by an equation of the form F(P) = 0 such that dF is nowhere zero. The gradient of F is then normal to the hypersurface.\\nSimilarly, an affine algebraic hypersurface may be defined by an equation F(x1, ..., xn) = 0, where F is a polynomial. The gradient of F is zero at a singular point of the hypersurface (this is the definition of a singular point). At a non-singular point, it is a nonzero normal vector.\\n\\n\\n=== Conservative vector fields and the gradient theorem ===\\n\\nThe gradient of a function is called a gradient field. A (continuous) gradient field is always a conservative vector field: its line integral along any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, and can be evaluated by the gradient theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals). Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function.\\n\\n\\n== Generalizations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Jacobian ===\\n\\nThe Jacobian matrix is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and differentiable maps between Euclidean spaces or, more generally, manifolds.

Over the past two episodes, we\\u2019ve talked a lot about computer security. But the fact is, there\\u2019s no such thing as a perfectly, 100% secure, computer system. There will always be bugs and security experts know that. So system architects employ a strategy called defence in depth, which uses many layers of varying security mechanisms to frustrate attackers. It\\u2019s a bit like how castles are designed \\u2013 first you\\u2019ve got to dodge the archers, then cross the moat, scale the walls, avoid the hot oil, get over the ramparts, and defeat the guards before you get to the throne room, but in this case we\\u2019re talking about one of the most common forms of computer security - Cryptography. INTRO The word cryptography comes from the roots \\u2018crypto\\u2019 and \\u2018graphy\\u2019, roughly translating to \\u201csecret writing\\u201d. In order to make information secret, you use a cipher \\u2013 an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext, which is gibberish unless you have a key that lets you undo the cipher. The process of making text secret is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption. Ciphers have been used long before computers showed up. Julius Caesar used what\\u2019s now called a Caesar cipher, to encrypt private correspondence. He would shift the letters in a message forward by three places. So, A became D, and the word \\\"brutus\\\" became this: \\\"euxwxv\\\". To decipher the message, recipients had to know both the algorithm and the number to shift by, which acted as the key. The Caesar cipher is one example of a larger class of techniques called substitution ciphers. These replace every letter in a message with something else according to a translation. A big drawback of basic substitution ciphers is that letter frequencies are preserved. For example, E is the most common letter in English, so if your cipher translates E to an X, then X will show up the most frequently in the ciphertext. A skilled cryptanalyst can work backwards from these kinds of statistics to figure out the message. Indeed, it was the breaking of a substitution cipher that led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 for plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth. Another fundamental class of techniques are permutation ciphers. Let\\u2019s look at a simple example, called a columnar transposition cipher. Here, we take a message, and fill the letters into a grid. In this case, we\\u2019ve chosen 5 by 5. To encrypt our message, we read out the characters in a different order, let\\u2019s say from the bottom left, working upwards, one column at a time. The new letter ordering, what\\u2019s called a permutation, is the encrypted message. The ordering direction, as well as the 5 by 5 grid size, serves as the key. Like before, if the cipher and key are known, a recipient can reverse the process to reveal the original message. By the 1900s, cryptography was mechanized in the form of encryption machines. The most famous was the German Enigma, used by the Nazis to encrypt their wartime communications. As we discussed back in Episode 15, the Enigma was a typewriter-like machine, with a keyboard and lampboard, both showing the full alphabet. Above that, there was a series of configurable rotors that were the key to the Enigma\\u2019s encryption capability. First, let\\u2019s look at just one rotor. One side had electrical contacts for all 26 letters. These connected to the other side of the rotor using cross-crossing wires that swapped one letter for another. If \\u2018H\\u2019 went in, \\u2018K\\u2019 might come out the other side. If \\u201cK\\u2019 went in, \\u2018F\\u2019 might come out, and so on. This letter swapping behavior should sound familiar: it\\u2019s a substitution cipher! But, the Enigma was more sophisticated because it used three or more rotors in a row, each feeding into the next. Rotors could also be rotated to one of 26 possible starting positions, and they could be inserted in different orders, providing a lot of different substitution mappings. Following the rotors was a special circuit called a reflector. Instead of passing the signal on to another rotor, it connected every pin to another, and sent the electrical signal back through the rotors. Finally, there was a plugboard at the front of the machine that allowed letters coming from the keyboard to be optionally swapped, adding another level of complexity. With our simplified circuit, let\\u2019s encrypt a letter on this example enigma configuration. If we press the \\u2018H\\u2019 key, electricity flows through the plugboard, then the rotors, hits the reflector, comes back through the rotors and plugboard, and illuminates the letter \\u2018L\\u2019 on the lampboard. So H is encrypted to L. Note that the circuit can flow both ways \\u2013 so if we typed the letter \\u2018L\\u2019, \\u2018H\\u2019 would light up. In other words, it\\u2019s the same process for encrypting and decrypting; you just have to make sure the sending and receiving machines have the same initial configuration. If you look carefully at this circuit, you\\u2019ll notice it\\u2019s impossible for a letter to be encrypted as itself, which turned out to be a fatal cryptographic weakness. Finally, to prevent the Enigma from being a simple substitution cipher, every single time a letter was entered, the rotors advanced by one spot, sort of like an odometer in a car. So if you entered the text A-A-A, it might come out as B-D-K, where the substitution mapping changed with every key press. The Enigma was a tough cookie to crack, for sure. But as we discussed in Episode 15, Alan Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park were able to break Enigma codes and largely automate the process. But with the advent of computers, cryptography moved from hardware into software. One of the earliest software ciphers to become widespread was the Data Encryption Standard developed by IBM and the NSA in 1977. DES, as it was known, originally used binary keys that were 56 bits long, which means that there are 2 to the 56, or about 72 quadrillion different keys. Back in 1977, that meant that nobody \\u2013 except perhaps the NSA \\u2013 had enough computing power to brute-force all possible keys. But, by 1999, a quarter-million dollar computer could try every possible DES key in just two days, rendering the cipher insecure. So, in 2001, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was finalized and published. AES is designed to use much bigger keys \\u2013 128, 192 or 256 bits in size \\u2013 making brute force attacks much, much harder. For a 128-bit keys, you'd need trillions of years to try every combination, even if you used every single computer on the planet today. So you better get started! AES chops data up into 16-byte blocks, and then applies a series of substitutions and permutations, based on the key value, plus some other operations to obscure the message, and this process is repeated ten or more times for each block. You might be wondering: why only ten rounds? Or why only 128 bit keys, and not ten thousand bit keys? Well, it\\u2019s a performance tradeoff. If it took hours to encrypt and send an email, or minutes to connect to a secure website, people wouldn't use it. AES balances performance and security to provide practical cryptography. Today, AES is used everywhere, from encrypting files on iPhones and transmitting data over WiFi with WPA2, to accessing websites using HTTPS. So far, the cryptographic techniques we\\u2019ve discussed rely on keys that are known by both sender and recipient. The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key. In the old days, keys would be shared by voice, or physically; for example, the Germans distributed codebooks with daily settings for their Enigma machines. But this strategy could never work in the internet era. Imagine having to crack open a codebook to connect to youtube! What\\u2019s needed is a way for a server to send a secret key over the public internet to a user wishing to connect securely. It seems like that wouldn\\u2019t be secure, because if the key is sent in the open and intercepted by a hacker, couldn\\u2019t they use that to decrypt all communication between the two? The solution is key exchange! \\u2013 An algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one. We can do this with one-way functions \\u2013 mathematical operations that are very easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse. To show you how one-way functions work, let\\u2019s use paint colors as an analogy. It\\u2019s easy to mix paint colors together, but it\\u2019s not so easy to figure out the constituent colors that were used to make a mixed paint color. You\\u2019d have to test a lot of possibilities to figure it out. In this metaphor, our secret key is a unique shade of paint. First, there\\u2019s a public paint color that everyone can see. Then, John and I each pick a secret paint color. To exchange keys, I mix my secret paint color with the public paint color. Then, I send that mixed color to John by any means \\u2013 mail, carrier pigeon, whatever. John does the same \\u2013 mixing his secret paint color with the public color, then sending that to me. When I receive John\\u2019s color, I simply add my private color to create a blend of all three paints. John does the same with my mixed color. And Voila! We both end up with the same paint color! We can use this as a shared secret, even though we never sent each other our individual secret colors. A snooping outside observer would know partial information, but they\\u2019d find it very difficult to figure out our shared secret color. Of course, sending and mixing paint colors isn\\u2019t going to work well for transmitting computer data. But luckily, mathematical one-way functions are perfect, and this is what Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange uses. In Diffie-Hellman, the one-way function is modular exponentiation. This means taking one number, the base, to the power of another number, the exponent, and taking the remainder when dividing by a third number, the modulus. So, for example, if we wanted to calculate 3 to the 5th power, modulo 31, we would calculate 3 to the 5th, which is 243, then take the remainder when divided by 31, which is 26. The hard part is figuring out the exponent given only the result and the base. If I tell you I raised 3 to some secret number, modulo 31, and got 7 as the remainder, you'd have to test a lot of exponents to know which one I picked. If we make these numbers big, say hundreds of digits long, then finding the secret exponent is nearly impossible. Now let\\u2019s talk about how Diffie-Hellman uses modular exponentiation to calculate a shared key. First, there's a set of public values \\u2013 the base and the modulus, that, like our public paint color, everyone gets to know... even the bad guys! To send a message securely to John, I would pick a secret exponent: X. Then, I\\u2019d calculate B to the power of X, modulo M. I send this big number over to John. John does the same, picking a secret exponent Y, and sending me B to the Y modulo M. To create a shared secret key, I take what John sent me, and take it to the power of X, my secret exponent. This is mathematically equivalent to B to the XY modulus M. John does the same, taking what I sent to him to the power of Y, and we both end up with the exact same number! It\\u2019s a secret shared key, even though we never sent each other our secret number. We can use this big number as a shared key for encrypted communication, using something like AES for encryption. Diffie-Hellman key exchange is one method for establishing a shared key. These keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides. The Caesar Cipher, Enigma and AES are all symmetric encryption. There\\u2019s also asymmetric encryption, where there are two different keys, most often one that\\u2019s public and another that\\u2019s private. So, people can encrypt a message using a public key that only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt. In other words, knowing the public key only lets you encrypt, but not decrypt \\u2013 it\\u2019s asymmetric! So, think about boxes with padlocks that you can open with a key. To receive a secure message, I can give a sender a box and padlock. They put their message in it and lock it shut. Now, they can send that box back to me and only I can open it, with my private key. After locking the box, neither the sender, nor anyone else who finds the box, can open it without brute force. In the same way, a digital public key can encrypt something that can only be decrypted with a private key. The reverse is possible too: encrypting something with a private key that can be decrypted with a public key. This is used for signing, where a server encrypts data using their private key. Anyone can decrypt it using the server's public key. This acts like an unforgeable signature, as only the owner, using their private key, can encrypt. It proves that you're getting data from the right server or person, and not an imposter. The most popular asymmetric encryption technique used today is RSA, named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. So, now you know all the \\u201ckey\\u201d parts of modern cryptography: symmetric encryption, key exchange and public-key cryptography. When you connect to a secure website, like your bank, that little padlock icon means that your computer has used public key cryptography to verify the server, key exchange to establish a secret temporary key, and symmetric encryption to protect all the back-and-forth communication from prying eyes. Whether you're buying something online, sending emails to BFFs, or just browsing cat videos, cryptography keeps all that safe, private and secure. Thanks cryptography!\",\n          \"Dictionaries are mappings from key objects to value objects. Dictionaries consists of Key:Value pairs, where the keys must be immutable and the values can be anything. Dictionaries themselves are mutable so this means once you create your dictionary, you can modify its contents on the fly. Dictionaries can be used for performing very fast look-ups on unordered data. A key aspect to be aware about regarding dictionaries is that they are not sequences, and therefore do not maintain any type of left-right order. This means that if you&#39;re looping over a dictionary, the Key:Value pairs will be iterated over in arbitrary order. Let&#39;s look at a diagram to clarify this idea. We&#39;re going to set up a simple dictionary where we have our first key that&#39;s associated with a value object. We have our second key that goes with another object. And let&#39;s say we have key number four here which goes with the corresponding value object. If this is a dictionary, this key object will always be associated with this value object. Similarly, this key will always go with this value object. When we say that dictionaries don&#39;t maintain any type of left or right order, what we&#39;re saying is that the ordering of these key-value pairs themselves is not defined. That means if I&#39;m looping over these pairs, I might first get the pair that corresponds to my second key here. Let&#39;s then look at some uses of dictionaries. I would like to set up a dictionary which is called age. And if I want this to be an empty dictionary, I have two ways to construct that. The first approach is just to use a pair of curly braces, and this would give me a dictionary age which would be empty at the time of construction. Another possibility is to type &quot;age = dict&quot;, which is a key word, open and close parentheses. And again I have created an empty dictionary. Let&#39;s then construct a dictionary that consists of names and ages. In this particular dictionary, the names are going to be the keys and the ages are going to be the value objects. Imagine the first task we&#39;d like to do is look up a person&#39;s age. We do this using the following syntax. We first type the name of the dictionary. We then follow with the square brackets. Inside the square brackets, we insert the key we&#39;re interested in looking up. Let&#39;s say, in this case, we&#39;d like to know, how old is Pam? So we&#39;d enter &quot;Pam&quot; inside the square brackets. And Python returns the result to us. Often, we&#39;d like to modify the value objects that are associated with specific keys. Let&#39;s say we would like to increase the age of Tim by one year. Here is how we could do this. We first take our age dictionary. We&#39;d like to modify Tim. And let&#39;s say we want to increase his age by one year. We could use the following kind of syntax. We could say age of Tim is equal to age of Tim plus 1. And this certainly works. However incrementing the value of an object by one, or by some other number, is a very common operation. And there&#39;s a very handy shorthand notation for doing that in Python. So let&#39;s take the age of Tim, and say we would like to increase that by one year, we can do the following: We can just type &quot;+= 1&quot;. And what happens if we check the age of Tim, we will have increased Tim age again by one year. Let&#39;s make sure we understand what happens when we say plus equals. When you&#39;re reading code from left to right, the plus operation happens first. Then we have the equal sign, which means assignment. So when we say something plus equals 1, for example, we first take the value of the object, we add one to that object, and then we reassign it back to the original object. A common mistake is sometimes to mix up the order of these two operations. Think about what happens if you say x equals plus 1. You&#39;re not incrementing the value of x by 1. Instead, you&#39;re saying that x should be assigned the value of plus 1, which is just the same thing as saying x is equal to 1. If you wish to increment the value of a variable by 1, you first do it the incrementation and then the assignment. That&#39;s why the order of these two operations is plus and then equals. You can use the dictionary method keys to find out what are all the keys in the dictionary. And similarly, you can use the values method to find out what are all of the values in the dictionary. When you call these methods, Python returns to you an object which has a very special type. The type of the returned object is what&#39;s called a &quot;view object&quot;. View objects do precisely what you might imagine that they do. They provide a dynamic view of the keys or values in the dictionary. A key point here is that as you update or modify your dictionary, the views will also change correspondingly. Let&#39;s now work with the dictionary that we just defined. We&#39;re going to first extract all of the names in the dictionary. So I&#39;ll do that by saying &quot;names = age.keys&quot;. Now let&#39;s just check the type of the object names. And Python confirms that this is a dictionary keys object. Let&#39;s say I would like to add a new key to my dictionary. Let&#39;s add a person called Tom who is 50 in our dictionary. So we say age[&quot;Tom&quot;] and we assign the value object 50 to that key. If we now ask, what are the names, you&#39;ll see that the view object also contains Tom. We didn&#39;t redefine the content of names, and this is the nature of view object. As we modify the dictionary, the content of the view object will change automatically. Let&#39;s look at the values method. So if we say age.values, Python returns to us all of the values in the dictionary. I&#39;m going to call this ages, and we can look at that object. So in this case, we have one, two, three, four, five different ages contained in the dictionary. I&#39;m going to add one more person to the dictionary. Let&#39;s call that person Nick, and let&#39;s say Nick is 31 years old. If I now ask Python, what are the names, you&#39;ll see that the name Nick is also contained in the names object. This is the nature of views objects-- their content is dynamically updated as you modify your dictionary. Finally, let&#39;s see how we&#39;ll test for membership in a dictionary. We know that we have a key Tom in our dictionary. If I want to ask if Tom is a member of our dictionary, if Tom is a key in our dictionary, I can ask, &quot;Tom&quot; in age? And the answer is going to be &quot;True&quot;. If I ask, is &quot;Zofia&quot; in our dictionary? Python is going to say &quot;False&quot;. This is how we test for object membership in a dictionary.\",\n          \"we previously defined the cost function J in this video I want to tell you about an algorithm called gradient descent for minimizing the cost function J it turns out gradient descent is a more general algorithm and is used not only in linear regression is actually used all over the place in machine learning and later in the class we'll use gradient descent to minimize other functions as well not just the cost function J for linear regression so in this video I'm going to talk about gradient descent for minimizing some arbitrary function J and then in later videos we'll take those algorithm and apply it specifically to the cost function J that we had defined for linear regression so here's the problem setup going to assume that we have some function J of theta 0 comma theta 1 maybe as a cost function from linear regression maybe it's some other function we want to minimize and we want to come over now algorithm for minimizing that as a function of j of theta0 theta1 just as an aside it turns out that gradient descent actually applies to more general functions so imagine if you have a function that's a function of j OS theta 0 theta 1 theta 2 up to say something that N and you want to minimize theta 0 you minimize over theta0 up to theta n of this J of theta 0 up to theta n it turns out gradient descent is an algorithm for solving of this more general problem but for the sake of brevity on for the sake of you know succinct ins of notation I'm just going to pretend I have only two parameters throughout the rest of this video here's the idea for gradients then what we're going to do is we're going to start off with some initial guesses for theta 0 and theta 1 doesn't really matter what they are but a common choice will be we set theta 0 to state 0 and set theta 1 to 0 just initialize them to 0 what we're going to do in gradient descent is we'll keep changing theta 0 and say the 1 a little bit they try to reduce J of theta 0 theta 1 until hopefully we wind up at a minimum or maybe a local so let's see what let's see in pictures what gradient descent does let's say you try to minimize this function so notice the axes this is a theta 0 theta 1 on the horizontal axis and J is the vertical axis and so the height of the surface shows J and we want to minimize this function so we're going to start off with theta 0 theta 1 at some point so imagine making some value for theta 0 theta 1 and that corresponds to starting at some points on the surface of this function okay so whatever value of theta 0 theta 1 gives you some point here I didn't initialize them to 0 0 but you know sometimes you neutralize it to other values as well now I want you to imagine that this figure shows a hole imagine this is like the landscape of some draw c-pop with you know two Hills like so and I want you to imagine that you are physically standing at that point on the hill right on this little red node on your Park in gradient descent what we're going to do is we're going to spin 360 degrees around just look all around us and also if I were to take a little baby step in some direction and I want to go downhill as quickly as possible what direction do I take that little baby step in if I want to go down if I sort of want to physically walk down this hill as rapidly as possible turns out that if you're standing at that point on the hill you look all around you find that the best direction to take a little little step downhill is roughly that direction okay and now you have this new point on your hill you're going to again look all around and then say what direction should I step in order to take a little baby step downhill and if you do that and take another step you take a step in that direction and then you keep going you know from this new point you look around taking decide what direction will take you down hill most quickly take another step another step and so on until you converge to this a local minimum down here here the dissenter is an interesting property this first time we ran gradient descent we were starting at this point over here right starts it at that point over here now imagine we have initialized gradient descent just a couple steps to the right imagine with a nationalized gradient descent with that points on the upper right if you were to repeat this process so stop at that point look all around take a little step in the direction of steepest descent you would do that then look around take another step and so on and if you started just a couple steps to the right gradient descent would have taken you to this second local optimum over on the right so if you have started this first point you would have wondered about this local optima but you started just a little bit slightly different location you would have wound up at a very different local optimum and this is a property of gradients in that will stay a little bit more about later so that's the intuition in pictures let's look at the map this is the definition of the gradient descent algorithm we're going to just repeat the Li do this until converging so we're going to update my parameter theta J by you know taking theta J and subtracting from it alpha at times this term over here okay so let's see a lot of details in this equation so let me unpack some of it first this notation here R colon equals going to use colon equals to denote assignment so the assignment operator so concretely if I write a colon equals B what this means is it means eel in a computer this means take the value in B and use it to overwrite whatever value is in so this means zero set a to be equal to the value of B it's its assignment and I can also do a colon equals a plus one this means take a and increase this value by one whereas in contrast if I use the equal sign then I write a equals B then this is a truth assertion okay so if I write a equals B then I'm asserting that the value of a equals to the value of B right so the left hand side that's the computer operation where you set the value of a to new value the right hand side this is asserting I'm just making a claim that the values of a and B are the same and so whereas I can write a colon equals a plus 1/10 is increment a by 1 hopefully I won't ever write a equals a plus 1 because this is wrong write a and a plus 1 can never be equal to the same values okay so there's the first part of the definition um this alpha here is a is a number that is called the learning rate and what alpha does is it basically controls how big a step we take downhill with creating descent so if alpha is very large then that corresponds to a very aggressive gradient descent procedure when we're trying to take huge steps downhill and if alpha is very small then we're taking little baby steps downhill and I'll come back and say more about this later about how to set alpha and so on and finally this term here that's a derivative term I don't want to talk about it right now but I will derive this derivative term and tell you exactly what this is later okay and some of you will be more familiar with calculus in others but even if you aren't familiar with calculus don't worry about it I'll tell you what you need to know about this term here now there's one more subtlety about gradient descent which is ingrained in descent we're going to update you know theta zero and theta one right so this update takes place for J equals zero and J equals ones you can update J theta zero and update theta one and the subtlety of how you implement gradient descent is for this expression right for this update equation you want to simultaneously update theta 0 and theta 1 what I mean by that is that you know in this equation we're going to update theta 0 co 2 equals theta 0 minus something and update theta 1 code equals theta 1 minus something and the way to implement is is you should compute the right hand side right compute that thing for theta 0 and theta 1 and then simultaneously at the same time update theta 0 and theta 1 okay so let me say what I mean by that this is a correct implementation of written meaning on simultaneous updates I'm going to set 10 0 equals at set 10 1 equals that so the basic computer right hand sides and then having computed the right hand sides and store them in two variables x 0 and temp 1 I'm going to year update theta 0 and theta 1 simultaneously that's a correct implementation in contrast here's an incorrect implementation that does not do a simultaneous update so in this incorrect implementation we compute 10 0 and then we update theta 0 let me compute tenth one and then we update 10 1 and the difference between the right hand side and the left hand side implementations is that if you look down here you look at this step if by this time you've already updated theta zero then you would be using the new value of theta 0 you know to compute this derivative term and so this gives you a different value of 10 1 then the left hand side right because you've now plugged in the new value of theta 0 into this equation and so this on the right hand side is not a correct implementation of gradient descent ok so I don't want to say why you need to do the simultaneous updates so it turns out that you know the way gradient descent is usually implemented we say more but later it actually turns out to be more natural to implement the simultaneous updates and when people talk about gradient descent they always mean simultaneous update if you implement the non simultaneous update it turns out it will probably work anyway but this is this album on the right is not what people refer to as free ascent and this is some other algorithm with different properties and for various reasons this behaves can behave and slightly stranger ways and so you know what you should do is really implement the simultaneous update of gradient descent so that's the outline of the gradient descent algorithm in the next video we're going to go into the details of the derivative term which I wrote I'll back didn't really define and if you take the calculus class before and if you're familiar with partial derivatives and derivatives it turns out that's exactly what that derivative term is but in case you aren't familiar of calculus don't worry about it the next video will give you all the intuitions and will tell you everything you need to know to compute that derivative term even if you haven't seen calculus or even you haven't seen partial derivatives before and with that with the next video hopefully we'll really give you all the intuitions you need to apply gradient descent\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others. Core concepts related to  information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\\nCryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names \\\"Alice\\\" (or \\\"A\\\") for the sender, \\\"Bob\\\" (or \\\"B\\\") for the intended recipient, and \\\"Eve\\\" (or \\\"E\\\") for the eavesdropping adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.\\nModern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed \\\"computationally secure\\\". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\\nThe growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nThe first use of the term \\\"cryptograph\\\" (as opposed to \\\"cryptogram\\\") dates back to the 19th century\\u2014originating from \\\"The Gold-Bug\\\", a story by Edgar Allan Poe.Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to \\\"encryption\\\", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into an unintelligible form (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a \\\"key\\\". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a string of characters (ideally short so it can be remembered by the user), which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext.  In formal mathematical terms, a \\\"cryptosystem\\\" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key.  Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks.\\nThere are two main types of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems. Asymmetric systems use a \\\"public key\\\" to encrypt a message and a related \\\"private key\\\" to decrypt it. The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key.  In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key, and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key. Examples of asymmetric systems include Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange, RSA (Rivest\\u2013Shamir\\u2013Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and Post-quantum cryptography. Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data Encryption Standard).  Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as Pig Latin or other cant, and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the one-time pad early in the 20th century.\\nIn colloquial use, the term \\\"code\\\" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a code word (for example, \\\"wallaby\\\" replaces \\\"attack at dawn\\\").  A cypher, in contrast, is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable, or a pair of letters, etc.) in order to produce a cyphertext.\\nCryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to \\\"crack\\\" encryption algorithms or their implementations.\\nSome use the terms \\\"cryptography\\\" and \\\"cryptology\\\" interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use \\\"cryptography\\\" to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and \\\"cryptology\\\" to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis. English is more flexible than several other languages in which \\\"cryptology\\\" (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. RFC 2828 advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptology.The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called cryptolinguistics. Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nBefore the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)\\u2014conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.\\n\\n\\n=== Classic cryptography ===\\nThe main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and substitution ciphers, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet). Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (c.\\u20091900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.\\nThe Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. Other steganography methods involve 'hiding in plain sight,' such as using a music cipher to disguise an encrypted message within a regular piece of sheet music. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.\\nIn India, the 2000-year-old Kamasutra of V\\u0101tsy\\u0101yana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.In Sassanid Persia, there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author Ibn al-Nadim: the \\u0161\\u0101h-dab\\u012br\\u012bya (literally \\\"King's script\\\") which was used for official correspondence, and the r\\u0101z-sahar\\u012bya which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.David Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs, the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. Al-Khalil (717\\u2013786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.\\nCiphertexts produced by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see cryptogram). Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.\\nLanguage letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.\\nEssentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the Vigen\\u00e8re cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigen\\u00e8re cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim\\u2014'the enemy knows the system'.\\nDifferent physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher. In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines\\u2014famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.\\n\\n\\n=== Early computer-era cryptography ===\\nCryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitive tasks, such as military code breaking (decryption). This culminated in the development of the Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.\\nExtensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent, beginning in the mid-1970s. In the early 1970s IBM personnel designed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the United States. In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange algorithm. In 1977 the RSA algorithm was published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column. Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\\nSome modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable, such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems, so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics. There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The one-time pad is one, and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that RSA is secure, and some other systems, but even so, proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers.  There are systems similar to RSA, such as one by Michael O. Rabin that are provably secure provided factoring  n = pq is impossible;  it is quite unusable in practice. The discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.As well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential impact of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography. The announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.\\n\\n\\n=== Modern cryptography ===\\nPrior to the early 20th century, cryptography was mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns. Since then cryptography has broadened in scope, and now makes extensive use of mathematical subdisciplines, including information theory, computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics. Cryptography is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition; other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics.\\nJust as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\\n\\n\\n== Modern cryptography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Symmetric-key cryptography ===\\n\\nSymmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.\\nSymmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher.\\nThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted). Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption to e-mail privacy and secure remote access. Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.Stream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the one-time pad. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. RC4 is a widely used stream cipher. Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers by generating blocks of a keystream (in place of a Pseudorandom number generator) and applying an XOR operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystream.Message authentication codes (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms, and so has been thought worth the effort. Cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output a short, fixed-length hash, which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \\\"prudent\\\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \\\"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\\\" Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\\n\\n\\n=== Public-key cryptography ===\\n\\nSymmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret.\\n\\nIn a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used\\u2014a public key and a private key. A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as \\\"the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance\\\".In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the public key is used for encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key.\\nThe X.509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificates.Diffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. This race was finally won in 1978 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, whose solution has since become known as the RSA algorithm.The Diffie\\u2013Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high-quality public-key algorithms, have been among the most widely used. Other asymmetric-key algorithms include the Cramer\\u2013Shoup cryptosystem, ElGamal encryption, and various elliptic curve techniques.A document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments. Reportedly, around 1970, James H. Ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, Clifford Cocks invented a solution that was very similar in design rationale to RSA. In 1974, Malcolm J. Williamson is claimed to have developed the Diffie\\u2013Hellman key exchange.\\nPublic-key cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to forge. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for signing, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for verification, in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and DSA are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes (e.g., SSL/TLS, many VPNs, etc.).Public-key algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of \\\"hard\\\" problems, often from number theory. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the integer factorization problem, while Diffie\\u2013Hellman and DSA are related to the discrete logarithm problem. The security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as modular multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptographic hash functions ===\\nCryptographic hash functions are functions that take a variable-length input and return a fixed-length output, which can be used in, for example, a digital signature. For a hash function to be secure, it must be difficult to compute two inputs that hash to the same value (collision resistance) and to compute an input that hashes to a given output (preimage resistance). MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \\\"prudent\\\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \\\"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\\\" Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptanalysis ===\\n\\nThe goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.\\nIt is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message. Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., \\\"work factor\\\", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher. Although well-implemented one-time-pad encryption cannot be broken, traffic analysis is still possible.\\nThere are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts. Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient. Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved).\\n\\nCryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks.\\nPublic-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithms, both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time (P) using only a classical Turing-complete computer. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P that can solve these problems, or using other technologies, such as quantum computers. For instance, the best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best-known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, to achieve an equivalent strength of encryption, techniques that depend upon the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, such as the RSA cryptosystem, require larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.\\nWhile pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called side-channel attacks. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, they may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. Social engineering and other attacks against humans (e.g., bribery, extortion, blackmail, espionage, rubber-hose cryptanalysis or torture) are usually employed due to being more cost-effective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptographic primitives ===\\nMuch of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives\\u2014algorithms with basic cryptographic properties\\u2014and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note, however, that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptosystems ===\\n\\nOne or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected backup data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols.\\nSome widely known cryptosystems include RSA, Schnorr signature, ElGamal encryption, and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). More complex cryptosystems include electronic cash systems, signcryption systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical' cryptosystems include interactive proof systems, (like zero-knowledge proofs) and systems for secret sharing,.\\n\\n\\n=== Lightweight cryptography ===\\nLightweight cryptography (LWC) concerns cryptographic algorithms developed for a strictly constrained environment. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithms that are better suited for the environment. An IoT environment requires strict constraints on power consumption, processing power, and security. Algorithms such as PRESENT, AES, and SPECK are examples of the many LWC algorithms that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n\\nCryptography is widely used on the internet to help protect user-data and prevent eavesdropping. To ensure secrecy during transmission, many systems use private key cryptography to protect transmitted information. With public-key systems, one can maintain secrecy without a master key or a large number of keys. But, some algorithms like Bitlocker and Veracrypt are generally not private-public key cryptography. For example, Veracrypt uses a password hash to generate the single private key. However, it can be configured to run in public-private key systems. The C++ opensource encryption library OpenSSL provides free and opensource encryption software and tools. The most commonly used encryption cipher suit is AES, as it has hardware acceleration for all x86 based processors that has AES-NI. A close contender is ChaCha20-Poly1305, which is a stream cipher, however it is commonly used for mobile devices as they are ARM based which does not feature AES-NI instruction set extension.\\n\\n\\n=== Cybersecurity ===\\nCryptography can be used to secure communications by encrypting them. Websites use encryption via HTTPS. \\\"End-to-end\\\" encryption, where only sender and receiver can read messages, is implemented for email in Pretty Good Privacy and for secure messaging in general in WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.Operating systems use encryption to keep passwords secret, conceal parts of the system, and ensure that software updates are truly from the system maker. Instead of storing plaintext passwords, computer systems store hashes thereof; then, when a user logs in, the system passes the given password through a cryptographic hash function and compares it to the hashed value on file. In this manner, neither the system nor an attacker has at any point access to the password in plaintext.Encryption is sometimes used to encrypt one's entire drive. For example, University College London has implemented BitLocker (a program by Microsoft) to render drive data opaque without users logging in.\\n\\n\\n=== Cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics ===\\nCryptographic techniques enable cryptocurrency technologies, such as distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchains), which finance cryptoeconomics applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi). Key cryptographic techniques that enable cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics include, but are not limited to: cryptographic keys, cryptographic hash function, asymmetric (public key) encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).\\n\\n\\n== Legal issues ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prohibitions ===\\nCryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies. Secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous. Because of its facilitation of privacy, and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high-quality cryptography possible.\\nIn some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, France significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In China and Iran, a license is still required to use cryptography. Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Tunisia, and Vietnam.In the United States, cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography. One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List. Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.\\n\\n\\n=== Export controls ===\\n\\nIn the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed. Daniel J. Bernstein, then a graduate student at UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.In 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the Wassenaar Arrangement, an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and \\\"dual-use\\\" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled. Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000; there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-exported mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include US-sourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via Transport Layer Security). The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook E-mail client programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with S/MIME. Many Internet users do not realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally do not find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.\\n\\n\\n=== NSA involvement ===\\n\\nAnother contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy. The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography. DES was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis, a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s. According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis, but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.\\nAnother instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement (i.e. wiretapping).\\n\\n\\n=== Digital rights management ===\\n\\nCryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes. This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.\\nThe United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA. Cryptologist Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security. Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the Motion Picture Association of America sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.\\n\\n\\n=== Forced disclosure of encryption keys ===\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security. Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009, resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment. Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.\\nIn the United States, the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the Fifth Amendment. In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.In many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.\\nThe 2016 FBI\\u2013Apple encryption dispute concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.\\nAs a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability, where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a drive which has been securely wiped).\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Python Dictionaries\\nthisdict = {\\n  \\\"brand\\\": \\\"Ford\\\",\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"Mustang\\\",\\n  \\\"year\\\": 1964\\n}\\nDictionary\\nDictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\\n\\nA dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\\n\\nAs of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.

At each point in the room, the gradient of T at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly, moving away from (x, y, z). The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.\\nConsider a surface whose height above sea level at point (x, y) is H(x, y). The gradient of H at a point is a plane vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector.\\nThe gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a dot product. Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40%. A road going directly uphill has slope 40%, but a road going around the hill at an angle will have a shallower slope. For example, if the road is at a 60\\u00b0 angle from the uphill direction (when both directions are projected onto the horizontal plane), then the slope along the road will be the dot product between the gradient vector and a unit vector along the road, as the dot product measures how much the unit vector along the road aligns with the steepest slope, which is 40% times the cosine of 60\\u00b0, or 20%.\\nMore generally, if the hill height function H is differentiable, then the gradient of H dotted with a unit vector gives the slope of the hill in the direction of the vector, the directional derivative of H along the unit vector.\\n\\n\\n== Notation ==\\nThe gradient of a function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n   at point \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n   is usually written as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\u2207\\n        f\\n        (\\n        a\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla f(a)}\\n  .

The notation grad f  is also commonly used to represent the gradient. The gradient of f is defined as the unique vector field whose dot product with any vector v at each point x is the directional derivative of f along v. That is,\\n\\nwhere the right-hand side is the directional derivative and there are many ways to represent it. Formally, the derivative is dual to the gradient; see relationship with derivative.\\nWhen a function also depends on a parameter such as time, the gradient often refers simply to the vector of its spatial derivatives only (see Spatial gradient).\\nThe magnitude and direction of the gradient vector are independent of the particular coordinate representation.\\n\\n\\n=== Cartesian coordinates ===\\nIn the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with a Euclidean metric, the gradient, if it exists, is given by\\n\\nwhere i, j, k are the standard unit vectors in the directions of the x, y and z coordinates, respectively.

Thus \\u2207f is a function from U to the space Rn such that\\n\\nwhere \\u00b7 is the dot product.\\nAs a consequence, the usual properties of the derivative hold for the gradient, though the gradient is not a derivative itself, but rather dual to the derivative:\\n\\nLinearity\\nThe gradient is linear in the sense that if f and g are two real-valued functions differentiable at the point a \\u2208 Rn, and \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 are two constants, then \\u03b1f + \\u03b2g is differentiable at a, and moreover \\nProduct rule\\nIf f and g are real-valued functions differentiable at a point a \\u2208 Rn, then the product rule asserts that the product fg is differentiable at a, and \\nChain rule\\nSuppose that f : A \\u2192 R is a real-valued function defined on a subset A of Rn, and that f is differentiable at a point a. There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function g is a parametric curve; that is, a function g : I \\u2192 Rn maps a subset I \\u2282 R into Rn. If g is differentiable at a point c \\u2208 I such that g(c) = a, then  where \\u2218 is the composition operator: (f\\u2009\\u2218\\u2009g)(x) = f(g(x)).More generally, if instead I \\u2282 Rk, then the following holds:\\n\\nwhere (Dg)T denotes the transpose Jacobian matrix.\\nFor the second form of the chain rule, suppose that h : I \\u2192 R is a real valued function on a subset I of R, and that h is differentiable at the point f(a) \\u2208 I. Then\\n\\n\\n== Further properties and applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Level sets ===\\n\\nA level surface, or isosurface, is the set of all points where some function has a given value.\\nIf f is differentiable, then the dot product (\\u2207f\\u2009)x \\u22c5 v of the gradient at a point x with a vector v gives the directional derivative of f at x in the direction v. It follows that in this case the gradient of f is orthogonal to the level sets of f. For example, a level surface in three-dimensional space is defined by an equation of the form F(x, y, z) = c. The gradient of F is then normal to the surface.\\nMore generally, any embedded hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold can be cut out by an equation of the form F(P) = 0 such that dF is nowhere zero. The gradient of F is then normal to the hypersurface.\\nSimilarly, an affine algebraic hypersurface may be defined by an equation F(x1, ..., xn) = 0, where F is a polynomial. The gradient of F is zero at a singular point of the hypersurface (this is the definition of a singular point). At a non-singular point, it is a nonzero normal vector.\\n\\n\\n=== Conservative vector fields and the gradient theorem ===\\n\\nThe gradient of a function is called a gradient field. A (continuous) gradient field is always a conservative vector field: its line integral along any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, and can be evaluated by the gradient theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals). Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function.\\n\\n\\n== Generalizations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Jacobian ===\\n\\nThe Jacobian matrix is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and differentiable maps between Euclidean spaces or, more generally, manifolds.

One of the most common forms of computer security is cryptography, which uses encryption algorithms to convert plaintext into ciphertext to make information secret, requiring a key to decrypt. \\n\\nCryptography has been used for centuries, with techniques evolving from simple substitution ciphers, such as the Caesar cipher, to more complex methods like the Enigma machine. Mechanized encryption began in the 1900s with devices such as the Enigma machine. Today, encryption is used everywhere to secure information, with one of the widely used encryption standards being the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\\n\\nWith the advent of computers, encryption moved from hardware to software. Symmetric encryption, where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, was commonly used, but there was no secure way to establish a shared key between two parties. Key exchange is needed to establish a secret key between parties, and this can be done using one-way functions. \\n\\nDiffie-Hellman key exchange is an algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one using one-way functions. The modular exponentiation is used to calculate a shared secret key. \\n\\nThere are two types of encryption, symmetric and asymmetric, which uses public and private keys. Asymmetric encryption allows for secure communication without a shared key, with messages encrypted using a public key that only the recipient can decrypt with their private key.\\n\\nCryptographic signatures, which verify the authenticity of messages, are made using the sender's private key and can be verified using their public key. This ensures that the sender cannot deny sending the message. \\n\\nIn the modern era, cryptography combines various cryptographic primitives to form complex algorithms known as cryptosystems, which provide security properties. Cryptography is essential in securing communications, verifying identities, and ensuring data integrity.\\n\\nCryptography is widely used to protect information on the internet, securing online transactions and communications. Applications such as HTTPS provide end-to-end encryption to ensure privacy. Cryptography is also used to secure passwords, encrypt data, and verify software integrity.\\n\\nCryptography also plays a vital role in digital rights management, ensuring the protection of copyrighted materials. Cryptographic techniques underlie the technology of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, enabling secure decentralized finance applications.\\n\\nThe growth of cryptographic technology has raised legal and ethical issues, with some governments classifying encryption as a weapon and restricting its use. Laws in some jurisdictions allow for the forced disclosure of encryption keys during criminal investigations, raising concerns about individual privacy and security.\\n\",\n          \"Dictionaries are mappings from key objects to value objects. They consist of Key:Value pairs, where the keys must be immutable and the values can be anything. Dictionaries themselves are mutable, allowing for modification of contents on the fly. Utilize dictionaries for performing very fast look-ups on unordered data.\\n\\nIt is crucial to note that dictionaries are not sequences and do not maintain any left-right order. When looping over a dictionary, the Key:Value pairs will be iterated over in an arbitrary order. \\n\\nIn Python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets. For example:\\n```\\nthisdict = {\\n  \\\"brand\\\": \\\"Ford\\\",\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"Mustang\\\",\\n  \\\"year\\\": 1964\\n}\\n```\\n* \\\"brand\\\", \\\"model\\\", and \\\"year\\\" are the keys in this dictionary, and the corresponding values are \\\"Ford\\\", \\\"Mustang\\\", and 1964.\\n\\nDictionaries allow for easy look-up of values by key, and new key-value pairs can be added or existing ones modified after the dictionary is created. In a dictionary \\\"age\\\", where names are keys and ages are values, one can find the age of a person by doing \\\"age[\\\"name\\\"]\\\". \\n\\nTo update a value associated with a key, such as increasing a person's age, you can do \\\"age[\\\"name\\\"] += 1\\\". This will increase the person's age by one. Be aware that if the key already exists, it will update the value, but if the key does not exist, it will create a new key-value pair.\\n\\nDictionaries in Python have dynamic \\\"view objects\\\" that are returned when calling the keys or values method. These view objects will change as you update or modify your dictionary.\\n\\nAs an example, using the dictionary \\\"age\\\" we can do the following:\\n```\\nnames = age.keys() # This will return a view object containing all the names in the dictionary\\nages = age.values() # This will return a view object containing all the ages in the dictionary\\n```\\nYou can then use these view objects to see if a key (name) exists in the dictionary already or if a value (age) exists in the dictionary. You can add a new key-value pair and see how the view objects dynamically change as you modify the dictionary. \\n\\nBy using the view objects, you do not need to extract all the names or ages in order to check membership or see all the keys and values.\\n\\nIn summary, dictionaries are a useful and versatile data structure in Python for storing key-value pairs, allowing for fast look-ups and efficient data manipulation.\",\n          \"\\ufeffIn this video, the instructor introduces the gradient descent algorithm as a method for minimizing a cost function J(\\u03b80, \\u03b81), which was previously defined, though noting that it can be applied to many other machine learning functions. Gradient descent works by iteratively updating the parameters \\u03b80 and \\u03b81 to approach a (local) minimum of J. The update equation for gradient descent is given by:\\n\\n```\\n\\u03b8J := \\u03b8J - \\u03b1*\\u2202J/\\u2202\\u03b8J\\n```\\n\\nWhere the symbol \\\":=\\\" denotes assignment, \\\"\\u03b1\\\" is the learning rate which controls the step size of the update, and \\u2202J/\\u2202\\u03b8J is the partial derivative term which measures the change in J with respect to the parameters. It should be noted that \\\"\\u03b1\\\" should be carefully chosen: a value too large, the algorithm may overshoot the minimum, and if too small, the algorithm will take longer to converge. \\n\\nAnother important note is that when applying this update, you want to update \\u03b80 and \\u03b81 simultaneously. An incorrect implementation of this would involve computing \\u03940 and updating it, then computing \\u03941 and updating it. The correct way of doing this would be to first compute the update values and then update the parameters simultaneously.\\n\\nThe instructor explains that gradient descent is looking for the direction of the steepest decrease and moves parameter values in that direction, iteratively, until convergence. Another note is that depending on where you start, you may end up at different local optima. There is also a remark about the non-standard way of implementation gives rise to a different algorithm with different properties.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"data"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-9c6acb6c-f6e7-45da-a659-baa098d5a0a2\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>transcript</th>\n","      <th>reading_material</th>\n","      <th>topic</th>\n","      <th>zero_shot</th>\n","      <th>few_shot</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Hi, I’m Carrie Anne, and welcome to CrashCours...</td>\n","      <td>Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Gree...</td>\n","      <td>Cryptography</td>\n","      <td>The transcript introduces computer security an...</td>\n","      <td>﻿Computer security always has to assume that t...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Dictionaries are mappings from key objects to ...</td>\n","      <td>Python Dictionaries\\nthisdict = {\\n  \"brand\": ...</td>\n","      <td>Dictionaries</td>\n","      <td>The transcript discusses the use and manipulat...</td>\n","      <td>Dictionaries are mappings from key objects to ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Strings are immutable sequences of characters....</td>\n","      <td>Strings\\nStrings in python are surrounded by e...</td>\n","      <td>Strings</td>\n","      <td>The transcript highlights various operations a...</td>\n","      <td>Strings in Python can be defined using either ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Hi, I’m Carrie Anne, and welcome to CrashCours...</td>\n","      <td>The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is ...</td>\n","      <td>World_Wide_Web</td>\n","      <td>The Transcript introduces the World Wide Web a...</td>\n","      <td>The World Wide Web, often confused with the in...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Sets are unordered collections of distinct has...</td>\n","      <td>Python Sets\\nmyset = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cher...</td>\n","      <td>Sets</td>\n","      <td>The transcript discusses sets, which are unord...</td>\n","      <td>Sets in Python are unordered collections of di...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>we previously defined the cost function J in t...</td>\n","      <td>In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-v...</td>\n","      <td>Gradient</td>\n","      <td>The transcript discusses the algorithm called ...</td>\n","      <td>﻿In this video, the instructor introduces the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>Welcome to the WebAudio API lesson!
