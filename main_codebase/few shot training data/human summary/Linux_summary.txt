* Topic: History of Linux and how it was built
* Linux is prevalent, with over 850,000 Android phones and 700,000 TVs activated daily.
* Linux powers 80% of financial trades and 90% of the world's supercomputers.
* Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon rely on Linux for their operations.
* Linux development is collaborative, involving thousands of developers from hundreds of companies.
* Since 2005, 8,000 developers have contributed 15 million lines of code to the Linux kernel.
* Linux development is rapid, with major kernel releases every 2-3 months.
   * This is made possible by a unique collaborative development process. When submitting code to the Linux kernel, developers break changes into individual units called patches. A patch describes the lines that need to be changed, added or removed from the source code. 
* Linux's unique collaborative development process ensures code quality and security.
   * Developers post their patches to the relevant mailing lists, where other developers can reply with feedback. When the patch is close to being release-ready, it is accepted by a senior Linux kernel developer or maintainer, who manages one or more of the 100 different sections of the kernel.
