* Topic: Boolean logic in python
* Expressions involve a boolean data type, which takes values True or False and must be capitalized.
* Boolean operations ("or", "and", "not") take boolean objects and return boolean results.
* "Or" returns True if either argument is True.
* "And" returns True only if both arguments are True.
* "Not" negates the value of its argument.
* Python provides eight comparison operations for various types, including numbers and sequences.
   * <: Less than
   * <=: Less than or equal to
   * >: greater than
   * >=: greater than or equal to
   * ==: Equal to
   * !=: Not equal to
   * is: Same object
   * is not: Different object
* Comparisons return boolean results, True or False.
* The "is" and "is not" operations test object identity, while other comparison operations test value equality
