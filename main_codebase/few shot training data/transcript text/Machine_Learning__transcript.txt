what this machine learning in this video we will try to define what it is and also try to give you a sense of when you want to use machine learning even among machine learning practitioners there isn't a well accepted definition of what is and what isn't machine learning but let me show you a couple of examples of the ways that people have tried to define it here's the definition of what is machine learning that is due to author Samuel he defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed Samuels claim to fame was that back in the 1950s he wrote a checkers playing program and the amazing thing about this checkers playing program was that Officer Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player but what he did was he had the program play tens of thousands of games against itself and by watching what sorts of board positions tended to lead to wins and what sort of board positions tended to veto losses the checkers playing program learned over time what are good board positions and what a bad board positions and eventually learned to play checkers better than Arthur Samuel himself was able to this was a remarkable result also Samuel himself turned out not to be a very good checkers player but because the computer has the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself no human has the patience to play that many games by doing this the computer was able to get so much checkers playing experience that it eventually became a better checkers player than offered Samuel himself this is somewhat informal definition and an older one here's a slightly more recent definition by Tom Mitchell who is a friend out in committee Mellon so Tom defines machine learning by saying that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows he says a computer program is said to learn from experience II with respect to some Tosti and some performance measure key evidence performance on T as measured by P improves of experience II I actually think he came up with this definition just to make it wrong for the checkers playing examples the experience II would be the experience of having the program play tens of thousands of games against itself the task T would be the task of playing checkers and the performance measure P would be the probability that wins the next game of checkers against some new opponent throughout these videos besides me trying to teach you stuff I'll occasionally ask you a question to make sure you understand the content here's one on top of the definition of machine learning by Tom McCullar let's say your email program watches which emails you do or do not value spam so in an email client like this you might click this spam button to report some email as spam but not other emails and based on which emails you Marcus them say your email program learns better how to filter a spam email what is the task of T in the setting in a few seconds the video will pause and when it does so you can use your mouse to select one of these four radio buttons to let to let me know which of these four you think is the right answer to this question so hopefully you got that this is the right answer classifying emails is a toss T in fact this definition defines the task T a performance measure P and the some experience e and so watching you label emails as spam or non-spam this would be the experience e and the fraction of emails correctly classified that might be our performance measure P and so our task performance on the task about systems performance on the task T on the performance measure P will improve after the experience e in this course I hope to teach you about various different types of learning algorithms there are several different types of learning algorithms the main two types are what we call supervised learning and unsupervised learning I'll define what these terms mean more in the next couple videos but it turns out that in supervised learning the idea is we're going to teach the how to do something whereas in unsupervised learning we're going to let it learn by itself don't worry if these two terms don't make sense yet in the next two videos I'm going to say exactly what these two types of learning on you will also hear all the buzz terms such as reinforcement learning and recommender systems these are other types of machine learning algorithms that we'll talk about later but the two most used types of learning algorithms are probably supervised learning and unsupervised learning and I'll define them in the next two videos and we'll spend most as far as talking about these two types of learning algorithms it turns out one of the other things we'll spend a lot of time on in this class is practical advice for applying learning algorithms this is something that I feel pretty strongly about and exactly something that I don't know of any other University teachers teaching about learning algorithms it's like giving you a set of tools and equally important or more important than giving you the tools is to teach you how to apply these tools I like to make an analogy to learning to become a carpenter imagine that someone is teaching you how to be a carpenter and they say here's a hammer here's a drive screwdriver is a saw good luck well that's no good right you have all these tools but the more important thing is to learn how to use these tools properly there's a huge difference we can keep between people that know how to use these machine learning algorithms versus people that don't know how to use these tools well here in Silicon Valley when I live when I go visit different companies even at the top Silicon Valley companies very often I see people trying to apply machine learning algorithms to some problem and sometimes there have been going at it for six months but sometimes when I look at what they're doing I say you know I could have told them like gee I could have told you six months ago or that you should be taking a learning algorithm and applying it in like the slightly modified way and your chance of success would have been much higher um so what we're going to do in this class is actually spend a lot of time talking about how if you're actually trying to develop a machine learning system how to make those best practices types decisions about the way in which you build your system so that when you apply learning algorithm you're less likely to end up one of those people who end up pursuing somehow for six months that you know someone else could have figured out just wasn't gonna work at all and it's a waste of time for six months so I'm actually spend a lot of time teaching you those sorts of best practices in machine learning and AI and how to get the stuff to work and how we do it or how the best people do it in Silicon Valley and around the world I hope to make you one of the best people and knowing how to design and build serious machine learning and AI systems so that's machine learning and these are the main topics I hope to teach in the next video I'm going to define what is supervised learning and after that what is unsupervised learning and also start to talk about when you will use each of them
