in this video I'm going to define whether it's probably the most common type of machine learning problem which is supervised learning I'll define supervised learning more formally later but it's probably best to explain I'll start with an example of what it is and we'll do the formal definition later let's say you want to predict housing prices a while back a student collected data sets from the city of Portland Oregon and let's say you plot the data set and it looks like this here on the horizontal axis the size of different houses and square feet and on the vertical axis the practice of different houses in thousands of dollars so given this data let's say you have a friend who owns a house that is saying 750 square feet and they're hoping to sell the house and they want to know how much they can get for the house so how can the learning algorithm help you one thing a learning algorithm might be able to do is put a straight line through the date arrow so the fit a straight line to the data and based on that it looks like maybe their holes can be so full maybe about 150 thousand dollars but maybe this isn't the only learning algorithm you can use and it might be a better one for example instead of fitting a straight line to the data we might decide that it's better to fill a quadratic function or a second-order polynomial to this data and if you do that to make a prediction here then it looks like well maybe they can sell the house well closer to $200,000 one of the things we'll talk about later is how to choose and how to decide do you want to fit a straight line to the data or do you want to fit a quadratic function the data and there's no fair picking whichever one gives your friend the better house to sell but each of these would be a fine example of a learning algorithm so this is an example of a supervised learning algorithm and the term supervised learning refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the right answers were given that is we gave it a data set of houses in which for every exam all in this data set we told it what is the right price what was the actual price that that holds so for and the TAS of the algorithm was to just produce more of these right answers such as for this new house you know that your friend may be trying to sell to define a bit more terminology this is also called a regression problem and by regression problem I mean we're trying to predict a continuous value output namely the price so technically against prices can be rounded off to the nearest cent so maybe prices are actually discrete value but usually we think of the price of a house as a roll number was a scalar value as a continuous value number and the term regression refers to the fact that we're trying to predict this sort of a continuous value to attribute here's another supervised learning examples some friends and I were actually working on this earlier let's say you want to look at medical records and try to predictive a breast cancer as malignant or benign if someone discovers a breast tumor a lump in their breast a malignant tumor is a tumor that is harmful and dangerous and a benign tumor is a tumor this is harmless so obviously people care a lot about this let's see collect the data set and suppose you're in your data set you have on your horizontal axis the size of the tumor and on the vertical axis I'm going to plot 1 or 0 yes or no whether or not these are examples of tumors we've seen before are malignant which is 1 or 0 of not malignant or benign so let's say your data set looks like this where we saw a tumor of this size that turned out to be benign one of this size one of this size and so on and sadly we also saw a few malignant tumors so one of that size one of that size one of that size so on so in this example I have 5 examples of benign tumors shown down here and 5 examples of malignant tumors shown with a vertical axis value of 1 and let's name a friend who tragically has a breast tumor and let's say her breast tumor size maybe somewhere around this value the machine learning question is can you estimate what is the probability what's the chance that the tumor is malignant versus benign to introduce a bit more terminology this is an example of a classification problem the term classification refers to the fact that here we're trying to predict a discrete value output zero or one malignant or benign and it turns out that in classification problem sometimes you can have more than two values for the two possible values for the output as a complete example maybe there are three types of breast cancers and so you may try to predict the discrete value output 0 1 2 or 3 where 0 may mean benign benign tumor so no cancer and one may mean a type 1 cancer I give three types of cancer whatever type one means and two may mean the second type of cancer and 3 may mean a third type of cancer but this would also be a classification problem because this other discrete value set of outputs corresponding to no cancer or cancer type 1 or cancer type 2 or type 3 in classification problems there is another way to plot this data let me show you what I mean I'm going to use a slightly different set of symbols to plot this data so if tumor science is going to be the attribute that I'm going to use to predict malignancy or benign Ness I can also draw my data like this I'm going to use different symbols to denote my benign and malignant or my a negative and positive examples so instead of drawing crosses I'm now going to draw holes for the benign tumors like so and I'm going to keep using X's to denote my malignant tumors ok I hope this make it make sense all I did was I took you know these my data set on top and I just mapped it down to this real line like so and started to use different symbol circles and crosses to denote malignant versus benign examples now in this example we use only one feature or one attribute namely the tumor size in order to predict whether tumor is malignant or benign in other machine learning problems we may have more than one feature or more than one attribute here's an example let's say that instead of just knowing the tumor size we know about the age of the patient and the tumor size in that case maybe your data set would look like this where I may have a set of patients with those ages in that tumor size and look like this and different set of patients that look a little different whose tumors turn out to be malignant as denoted by the crosses so let's say you have a friend who tragically has a tumor and maybe their tumor size and age falls around there so given the data set like this what the learning algorithm may do is for the straight line to the data to try to separate out the malignant tumors from the benign ones and so the learning algorithm may decide to for the straight line like that to separate out the two classes of tumors and you know with this hopefully we can decide that your friend's tumor is more likely so if it was over there then hopefully in the learning algorithm will say that your friend's tumor falls on this benign side and is therefore more likely to be benign than malignant in this example we had two features namely the age of the patient and the size of the tumor in other machine learning problems we will often have more features and my friends that work on this problem they actually use other features like these which is clump thickness clump thickness of the breast tumor uniformity of cell size of the tumor uniformity of cell shape of the tumor and so on and other features as well and it turns out one of the interests most interesting learning algorithms that we'll see in this false as a learning algorithm they can deal with not just two or three or five features but an infinite features on this slide I've listed a total of five different features right - on the axes and three more up here but it turns out that for some learning problems what you really want is not to use like three or five features but instead you want to use an infinite number of features an infinite number of attributes so that your learning algorithm has lots of attributes or features or cues with which to make those predictions so how do you deal with an infinite number of features and so how do you even store an infinite number of things on a computer and your computer can run on the memory well it turns out that when we talk about an algorithm called the support vector machine there will be a neat mathematical trick that will allow a computer to deal with an infinite number of features imagine that I didn't just write down you know two features here and three features on the right but imagine that I wrote down an infinitely long list I just kept writing more and more and more feature that's like an infinitely long list of features turns out we'll be able to come up with an algorithm that can deal with that so just to recap in this class we'll talk about supervised learning and the idea is that in supervised learning in every example in our dataset we are told what is the correct answer that we would have quite like the algorithms are predicted on that example such as the price of the house or whether a tumor is malignant or benign we also talked about the regression problem and by regression that means that our goal is to predict a continuous valued output and we talked about the classification problem where the goal is to predict a discrete value output just a quick wrap-up question suppose you're running a company and you want to develop learning algorithms to address each of two problems in the first problem you have a large inventory of identical items so imagine that you have thousands of copies of some identical item to sell and you want to predict how many of these items you sell over the next three months in the second problem problem to you you light you you have lots of users and you want to write software to examine each individual of your customers accounts so each one of your customers account and for each account decide whether or not the account has been hacked or compromised so for each of these problems should they be treated as a classification problem or as a regression problem when the video pauses please use your mouse to select whichever of these four options on the left you think is the correct answer so hopefully you got that this is the answer for problem 1 I would treat this as a regression problem because if I have you know thousands of items well I would probably just treat this as a real value as a continuous value and treat therefore the number of items I sell as a continuous value and for the second problem I would treat that as a classification problem because I might say set the value I want to predict to be 0 to denote the account has not been hacked and set the value 1 to denote an account that has been hacked into so just like your breast cancers right 0 or benign 1 is malignant so I might set this be 0 or 1 depending whether it's been hacked and have an algorithm try to predict each one of these two discrete values and because that's a small number of discrete values I would therefore treat it as a classification problem so that's it for supervised learning and in the next video I will talk about unsupervised learning which is the other major category of learning algorithm
