in this video we'll talk about the second major type of machine learning problem called unsupervised learning in the last video we talked about supervised learning back then we count data sets that look like this where each example was labeled either as a positive or a negative example whether it was a benign or a malignant tumor so for each example in supervised learning we were told explicitly what is the so-called right answer whether it's benign or malignant in unsupervised learning we're given data that looks different in green data that looks like this that doesn't have any labels or that of all has the same label or really no labels so we're given the data set and we're not told what to do a bit and we're not told what each data point is instead we just told here is a data set can you find some structure in the data given this data set an unsupervised learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in two different clusters so there's one cluster and there's a different cluster and the unsupervised learning algorithm may break this data into these two separate clusters so this is called a clustering algorithm and this turns out to be used in many places one example where clustering is used is in Google News and if you're not seeing this before you can actually go to this URL news.google.com to take a look what Google News does is every day it goes and looks at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of new stories on the web and it groups them into cohesive news stories for example let's look here the URLs here link to different news stories about the BP oil well story so let's say I click on one of these URLs and I click on one of these URLs what I'll get to is a web page like this here's a Wall Street Journal article about you know the BP oil wells still stories of BP cause Macondo which is the name of the un-- scope and if you click on a different URL from that group then you might get the different story she's a CNN story about again the BP oil spill and if you click on get a third link that you might get a different story here's the UK Guardian story about the BP oil spill so a Google News is done is looked at tens of thousands of new stories and automatically cluster them together so the new stories that are all about the same topic get to display together it turns out that clustering algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms are used in many other problems as well here's one on understanding genomics here's an example of DNA microarray data the idea is you have a group of different individuals and for each of them you measure how much they do or do not have a certain gene technically you measure how much of certain genes are expressed so these colors red green gray and so on they show the degree to which different individuals do or do not have a specific gene and what you can do is then run a clustering algorithm to group individuals into different categories onto different types of people so this is unsupervised learning because we're not telling the algorithm in advance that you know these are Taiwan people those are type 2 persons those are type 3 persons and so on and instead what we're saying is you know here's a bunch of data I don't know what's in this data I don't know who's in what type I didn't know what the different types of people are but can you automatically find structure in the data from you automatically cluster the individuals into these types that I don't know in advance because we're not giving them the algorithm the right answer for the examples in my data set this is unsupervised learning unsupervised learning or clustering is used for a bunch of other applications is used to organize large computer clusters I had some friends looking at large data centers that there's large computer clusters and trying to figure out which machines tend to work together and if you can put those machines together you can make your data center work more efficiently your second application on social network analysis so given knowledge about which friends you email the most or given your Facebook friends or your Google+ Circles can we automatically identify which are cohesive groups of friends so what are groups of people that all know each other market segmentation many companies have huge databases of customer information so can you look at this customer data set and automatically discover market segments and automatically group your customers into different market segments so that you can automatically and more efficiently sell or market to your different market segments together again this is unsupervised learning because we have all this customer data but we don't know in advance what are the market segments and for the customers in our data set you know we don't know in advance who is in microsecond one who is in market segments two and so on but we have to let the algorithm discover all this just from the data finally it turns out that unsupervised learning is also used for surprisingly astronomical data analysis and these clustering algorithms give surprisingly interesting or useful theories of how galaxies are formed all these are examples of clustering which is just one type of unsupervised learning let me tell you about another one I'm going to tell you about the cocktail party problem so we've been the cocktail parties before right where you can imagine there's a party room for people all sitting around all talk at the same time and there are all these overlapping voices because everyone's talked in the same time and it's almost hard to hear the person in front of you so maybe have a cocktail party with two people two people talking the same time and someone small cocktail party and we're going to put two microphones in the room so there are microphones and because these microphones are at two different distances from the speaker's each microphone records a different combination of these two speakers voices maybe speaker one is a little louder in microphone one and maybe speaker two is a little bit louder in microphone two because you know the two microphones are at different positions relative to the 2 speakers but each microphone recalls an overlapping combination of both speakers voices so here's an here's an actual recording two speakers recorded by a researcher let me play for you the first one the first microphone sounds like one two three one my head alright maybe not the most interesting cocktail party is two people counting from one to ten in two languages that you know there you go what you just heard was the first microphone recording here's the second recording you see the names so we can do is take these two microphone recordings and give them to an unsupervised learning algorithm called the cocktail party algorithm and tell the algorithm find structure in this data for me and what the album will do is listen to these audio recordings and say you know it sounds like the two audio recordings that being added together or there being some together to produce these recordings that we had moreover what the cocktail party algorithm will do is separate out these two audio sources that were being added or being summed together to form our recordings and in fact here's the first output of the cocktail party algorithm one two three oh five six seven eight nine ten so separated out the English voice in one of us in one of the recordings and here's the second output uno dos tres cuatro Cinco seis fifty all true really it is not too bad to give you one more example here's another recording of another similar situation here's the first microphone okay so the poor guys gone home from the cocktail party and he's now studying the route by himself talking to his video he has the second microphone recording when you give these two microphone recording to the same algorithm what it does is again say you know it sounds like there are two audio sources and moreover the album says here is the first of the audio sources I found one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so that wasn't perfect it got the boys but they'll also go up into the music in there then here's the second output of the algorithm II not too bad in that second output and managed to get rid of the voice entirely and just Co cleaned up the music and got rid of the counting from one to ten so you might look at an unsupervised learning algorithm like this and ask how complicated is it to implement this it seems like in order to you know build this application it seems like to do this audio processing you need to write a ton of code or maybe link into like a bunch of C++ or Java libraries to process audio it seems like an really complicated program to do this audio separating out audio and so on it turns out the algorithm to do what you just heard that can be done with one line of code shown right here it did take me searches a long time to come up with this line of code so I'm not saying this is an easy problem but it turns out that we use the right programming environment many learning algorithms can be really short programs so this is also why in this class we're going to use the octave programming environment octave is free open source software and using a tool like octave or MATLAB many learning algorithms become just a few lines of code to implement later in this class also teach you a little bit about how to use octave and you'll be implementing some of these albums in octave or if you have MATLAB you can use that - turns out that Silicon Valley for a lot of machine learning algorithms what we do is first prototype our software in octave because software that octave makes it incredibly fast implement these learning algorithms here are each of these functions like for example the SVD function that sends the singular value decomposition but that turns out to be a linear algebra routine that is just built into octave if you were trying to do this a C++ or Java this would be many many lines of code linking complex C++ or Java libraries so you can implement this stuff in C++ or Java or Python there's just much more complicated to use to do some of those languages what I've seen after having taught machine learning for almost about a decade now is that you learn much faster if you use octave as your programming environment and if you use octave as your learning tool and as your prototyping tool I'll let you learn and prototype learning rooms much more quickly and in fact what many people will do in the large Silicon Valley companies is in fact use an algorithm like octave to first prototype the learning algorithm and only after you've gotten to where and then you migrate it to C++ or Java or whatever it turns out that by doing things this way you can often get your algorithm to work much faster than if you were starting out in C++ so I know that this instruct as an instructor I get to say trust me on this one only a finite number of times but for those of you who have never used these octave type programming environments before I'm going to answer there trust me on this one and say that you you will I think your time when you develop a time is one of the most valuable resources and having seen lots of people do this I think you as a machine learning researcher or machine learning developer will be much more productive if you learn to stuff in prototype to stuff in octave and in some of the language finally to wrap up this video have one quick review question for you we talked about unsupervised learning which is the learning setting where you give the algorithm a ton of data and just ask it to find structure in the data for us of the following four examples which ones which of these four do you think would be an unsupervised learning out algorithm as opposed to a supervised learning problem for each of the four check boxes on the Left check the ones or which you think of unsupervised learning algorithm would be appropriate and then click the button on the lower right to check your answer so when the video pauses please answer the question on the slide so hopefully remember the spam filter problem if you have labeled data you know with of spam and non-spam email we treat this as a supervised learning problem the new story example that's exactly the Google News example that we saw in this video we saw how you can use a clustering algorithm to cluster news articles together so that's unsurprising learning the market segmentation example I talked a little bit earlier do that as an unsupervised learning problem because I'm just going to give my from data and ask you to discover market segments automatically and the final example diabetes well that's actually just like our breast cancer example from the last video only instead of you know good and bad cancer tumors or benign and malignant tumors we instead have have diabetes or not and so we will use that as a supervised we will solve that as a supervised learning problem just like we did for the breast tumor data so that's it for unsupervised learning and in the next video we'll delve more into specific learning algorithms and start to talk about just how these algorithms work and how we can how you can go about implementing them
